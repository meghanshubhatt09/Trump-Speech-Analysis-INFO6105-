one nice person give lot money away charities and other things think actually very nice person."" but said, ""this going election that based competence, because people are tired these nice people. and they tired being ripped off everybody the world. and they tired spending more money education than any nation the world per capita, than any nation the world, and are 26th the world countries are better than education. and some them are like third world countries. but becoming third word country, because our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything one the things did, and said, you know what. because lot people said never run. number one won want give his lifestyle."" trump: they right about that, but doing. number two private company nobody knows what worth. and the one thing that when you run, you have announce and certify all sorts governmental authorities your net worth said, ""that proud net worth done amazing job started off — thank you started off small office with father brooklyn and queens, and father said — and love father learned much was great negotiator learned much just sitting his feet playing with blocks listening him negotiate with subcontractors. but learned lot. but used say, ""donald, don into manhattan. that the big leagues don know anything about that. don said gotta into manhattan gotta build those big buildings gotta, dad gotta."" and after four five years brooklyn ventured into manhattan and did lot great deals — the grand hyatt hotel was responsible for the convention center the west side did lot great deals, and did them early and young. and now building all over the world, and love what doing. but they all said lot the pundits television, ""well, donald will never run, and one the main reasons private and probably not successful everybody thinks said myself, you know, nobody ever going know unless run, because really proud success really employed employed tens thousands people over lifetime. that means medical. that means education. that means everything large accounting firm and accountants have been working for months, because big and complex, and they put together statement financial statement, just summary. but everything will filed eventually with the government, and don extensions anything filing right time don need anything.  and was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said had assets billion said, that the wrong number. that the wrong number. not assets they put together this. and before say have say this made the old-fashioned way real estate. you know real estate labor, and unions good and some bad and lots people that aren unions, and all over the place and building all over the world. and have assets — big accounting firm, one the most highly respected billion 240 million dollars. audience member: yeah. trump: and have liabilities about $500 million. that long-term debt, very low interest rates fact, one the big banks came and said, ""donald, you don have enough borrowings. could loan you billion said don need don want. and been there don want."" but two seconds, they give whatever wanted have total net worth, and now with the increase well-over billion. but here total net worth — net worth, not assets, not net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — trump tower, 1290 avenue the americas, bank america building san francisco wall street, sometimes referred the trump building right opposite the new york — many other places all over the world the total,737,540. now not doing that not doing that brag, because you know what don have brag don have, believe not doing that say that that the kind thinking our country needs need that thinking have the opposite thinking have losers have losers have people that don have have people that are morally corrupt have people that are selling this country down the drain put together this statement, and the only reason telling you about today because really have get going, because have another three four years — you know trillion now soon going trillion. according the economists — who not big believers, but, nevertheless, this what they saying — that trillion very close — that the point return trillion will there soon. that when become greece. that when become country that unsalvageable. and gonna there very soon gonna there very soon. audience member: make america strong. trump, just sum would various things very quickly would repeal and replace the big lie, obamacare. audience member: yeah would build great wall, and nobody builds walls better

and make really work. nobody, nobody will pushing around. audience member: yes.  trump will stop iran from getting nuclear weapons. and won using man like secretary kerry that has absolutely concept negotiation, who making horrible and laughable deal, who just being tapped along they make weapons right now, and then goes into bicycle race years old, and falls and breaks his leg won doing that. and promise will never bicycle race. that can tell you will immediately terminate president obama illegal executive order immigration, immediately.  fully support and back the second amendment.  now very interesting. today heard. through stupidity very, very hard core prison, interestingly named clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. and woman

now since this happened the prison area husband and are finally agreement, because wanted the guns now have gun every table ready start shooting said, ""very interesting protect the second amendment.  end — end common core. common core should disaster. bush totally favor common core don see how can possibly get the nomination weak immigration favor common core. how the hell can you vote for this guy? you just can have end — education has local. rebuild the country infrastructure. audience member: yeah. trump: nobody can that like. believe will done time budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought look the roads being built all over the country, and say can build those things for one-third. what they unbelievable, how bad. you know building pennsylvania avenue, the old post office converting into one the world great hotels gonna the best hotel washington got from the general services administration washington. the obama administration got was the most highly sought after one them, but think the most highly sought after project the history general services got. people were shocked, trump got. well got for two reasons. number one really good. number two had really good plan. and add the third had great financial statement. because the general services, who are terrific people the way, and talented people, they wanted great job. and they wanted make sure got built. trump have rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. you come into guardia airport like third world country. you look the patches and the-year-old floor. they throw down

the money that being lost. renegotiate our foreign trade deals. audience member: yes.  trump: reduce our trillion debt, because, believe bubble have artificially low interest rates have stock market that, frankly, has been good, but still hate see what happening have stock market that bloated careful bubble because what you seen the past might small potatoes compared what happens very, very careful. and strengthen our military and take care our vets important. audience member: yes.  trump: sadly, the american dream dead. audience member: bring back. trump: but get elected president will

" good evening. thank you very much speak you today lifelong supporter and true friend israel newcomer politics, but not backing the jewish state 2001, weeks after the attacks new york city and washington and frankly, the attacks all, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated the islamic fundamentalists, mayor rudy giuliani visited israel show solidarity with terror victims sent plane, because backed the mission for israel 100 percent spring 2004 the height the violence the gaza strip was the grand marshal the 40th salute israel parade, the largest single gathering support the jewish state was very dangerous time for israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting israel. many people turned down this honor did not took the risk and glad did. but didn come here tonight pander you about israel. that what politicians, all talk action, believe came here speak you about where stand the future american relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy the middle east, the state israel. thank you number one priority dismantle the disastrous deal with iran. thank you have been business long time know deal making and let tell you, this deal catastrophic for america, for israel and for the whole the middle east. the problem here fundamental rewarded the world leading state sponsor terror with 150 billion dollars and received absolutely nothing return studied this issue great detail would say, actually, greater far than anybody else, believe, believe. and bad deal. the biggest concern with the deal not necessarily that iran going violate, because already you know has. the bigger problem that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb simply running out the clock. and course, they keep the billions and billions dollars that stupidly and foolishly gave them. the deal doesn even require iran dismantle its military nuclear capability. yes places limits its military nuclear program for only certain number years, but when those restrictions expire, iran will have industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready and with zero provision for delay matter how bad iran behavior. terrible, terrible situation that are all placed, and especially israel. when president will adopt strategy that focuses three things when comes iran. first will stand iran aggressive push destabilize and dominate the region. iran very big problem and will continue, but not elected president know how deal with trouble, and believe, that why going elected president, folks. and are leading every poll, remember that, please. iran problem iraq problem syria problem lebanon problem yemen and will very, very major problem for saudi arabia. literally, every day iran provides more and better weapons support their puppet states, hezbollah, lebanon received, and tell you what has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and gps systems and rockets like very few people anywhere the world and certainly very few countries have. now they syria trying establish another front against israel from the syrian side the golan heights gaza, iran supporting hamas, and islamic jihad. and the west bank, they openly offering palestinians,000 dollars per terror attack and,000 dollars for every palestinian terrorist home that been destroyed deplorable, deplorable situation. iran financing military forces throughout the middle east and absolutely incredible that handed them over 150 billion dollars even more toward the many horrible acts terror. secondly will totally dismantle iran global terror network, which big and powerful, but not powerful like. iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. during the last five years, iran has perpetuated terror attacks different countries five continents. they got terror cells everywhere, including the western hemisphere very close home. iran the biggest sponsor terrorism around the world and will work dismantle that reach, believe, believe. third the very least must enforce the terms the previous deal hold iran totally accountable and will enforce like you never seen contract enforced before, folks, believe. iran has already, since the deal place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. those ballistic missiles, with range,250 miles, were designed intimidate not only israel, which only 600 miles away, but also intended frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states and not going let that happen not letting happen and not letting happen israel, believe. thank you you want hear something really shocking many the great people this room know, painted those missiles both hebrew and farsi were the words ""israel must wiped off the face the earth."" you can forget that. what kind demented minds write that hebrew? and here another. you talk about twisted, here another twisted part. testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that made. the deal silent test missiles, but those tests violate the united nations security council resolutions. the problem one has done anything about will promise will. thank you. which brings next point, the utter weakness and incompetence the united nations. the united nations not friend democracy not friend freedom not friend even the united states america; whereas you know has its home and surely not friend israel. with president obama his final year, yay may the worst thing ever happen israel, believe, believe, and you know better than anybody with the president his final year, discussions have been swirling about attempt bring security council resolution terms eventual agreement between israel and palestine. let clear agreement imposed the united nations would total and complete disaster. the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power our veto, which will use president 100 percent. when people ask why because that not how you make deal. deals are made when parties come together, they come table and they negotiate. each side must give something, its values mean have something where there value exchange for something that requires. that what deal deal really something that when impose israel and palestine bring together group people that come with something. that not going happen with the united nations will only further, very importantly will only further delegitimize israel will catastrophe and disaster for israel not going happen, folks. and further would reward palestinian terrorism, because every day they stabbing israelis and even americans. just last week, american taylor allen force west point grad, phenomenal young person who served iraq and afghanistan was murdered the street knife-wielding palestinian. you don reward behavior like that. you cannot. there only one way you treat that kind behavior. you have confront not the united nations really with solution really the parties that must negotiate resolution themselves. they have choice, they have themselves will never hold anyway. the united states can useful facilitator negotiations, but one should telling israel that must abide some agreement made others thousands miles away that don even really know what happening israel anything the area preposterous not going let that happen. when president, believe will veto any attempt the impose its will the jewish state will vetoed 100 percent. you see know about deal making, that what wrote the art the deal. one the bestselling all-time, and mean, seriously saying ""one,"" because criticized say ""the going very diplomatic, ""one criticized think number one, but why take chance. one the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making make great deal, you need two willing participants know israel willing deal. israel has been trying. that right. israel has been trying sit down the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. you had camp david 2000 where prime minister barak made incredible offer, maybe even too generous; arafat rejected 2008, prime minister olmert made equally generous offer; the palestinian authority rejected also. then john kerry tried come with the framework and abbas didn even respond, not even the secretary state the united states america. they didn even respond. when become president, the days treating israel like second-class citizen will end day one. thank you. and when say something mean will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately have known him for many years and able work closely together help bring stability and peace israel and the entire region. meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught hate israel and hate the jews has stop. when you live society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want firefighters. when you live society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want athletes and movie stars palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder jews can let this continue can let this happen any longer. you cannot achieve peace terrorists are treated martyrs. glorifying terrorists tremendous barrier peace horrible way think barrier that can broken. that will end and end soon, believe palestinian textbooks and mosques, you got culture hatred that has been fomenting there for years and want achieve peace, they got out and they got start sic this educational process. they have end education hatred. they have end and now. there moral equivalency. israel does not name public squares after terrorists. israel does not pay its children stab random palestinians. you see, what president obama gets wrong about deal making that constantly applies pressure our friends and rewards our enemies. and you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced the president and his administration, including former secretary state hillary clinton who total disaster the way. she and president obama have treated israel very, very badly. but repeated itself over and over again and done nothing embolden those who hate america saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars iran the hope that they would magically join the world community didn happen. president obama thinks that applying pressure israel will force the issue, but precisely the opposite that happens. already half the population palestine has been taken over the palestinian isis hamas and the other half refuses confront the first half very difficult situation that never going get solved unless you have great leadership right here the united states get solved one way the other will get solved. but when the united states stands with israel, the chances peace really rise and rises exponentially. that what will happen when donald trump president the united states will move the american embassy the eternal capital the jewish people, jerusalem. and will send clear signal that there daylight between america and our most reliable ally, the state israel. the palestinians must come the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel absolutely totally unbreakable. they must come the table willing and able stop the terror being committed daily basis against israel. they must that. and they must come the table willing accept that israel jewish state and will forever exist jewish state love the people this room love israel love israel been with israel long terms received some greatest honors from israel father before, incredible daughter ivanka about have beautiful jewish baby fact could happening right now, which would very nice far concerned want thank you very much, this has been truly great honor. thank you, everybody. thank you. thank you very much.

our country  one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace time shake the rust off america foreign policy time invite new voices and new visions into the fold. the direction will outline today will also return timeless principle foreign policy will always put the interests the american people, and american security, above all else. that will the foundation every decision that will make. america first will the major and overriding theme administration. but chart our path forward must first briefly look back have lot proud the 1940s saved the world. the greatest generation beat back the nazis and the japanese imperialists. then saved the world again, this time from totalitarian communism. the cold war lasted for decades, but won. democrats and republicans working together got. gorbachev heed the words president reagan when said: ""tear down this wall."" history will not forget what did. unfortunately, after the cold war, our foreign policy veered badly off course failed develop new vision for new time fact time went, our foreign policy began make less and less sense. logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led one foreign policy disaster after another went from mistakes iraq egypt libya president obama line the sand syria. each these actions have helped throw the region into chaos, and gave isis the space needs grow and prosper all began with the dangerous idea that could make western democracies out countries that had experience interest becoming western democracy tore what institutions they had and then were surprised what unleashed. civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands american lives, and many trillions dollars, were lost result. the vacuum was created that isis would fill. iran, too, would rush and fill the void, much their unjust enrichment. our foreign policy complete and total disaster vision purpose direction strategy. today want identify five main weaknesses our foreign policy. first, our resources are overextended president obama has weakened our military weakening our economy crippled with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth huge trade deficit and open borders. our manufacturing trade deficit with the world now approaching trillion year rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. ending the theft american jobs will give the resources need rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strength the only person running for the presidency who understands this problem and knows how fix. secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share. our allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs our tremendous security burden. but many them are simply not doing. they look the united states weak and forgiving and feel obligation honor their agreements with nato, for instance, only other member countries, besides america, are spending the minimum required gdp defense have spent trillions dollars over time planes, missiles, ships, equipment  building our military provide strong defense for europe and asia. the countries are defending must pay for the cost this defense  and not, the. must prepared let these countries defend themselves. the whole world will safer our allies their part support our common defense and security trump administration will lead free world that properly armed and funded. thirdly, our friends are beginning think they can depend had president who dislikes our friends and bows our enemies negotiated disastrous deal with iran, and then watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry. iran cannot allowed have nuclear weapon and, under trump administration, will never allowed have nuclear weapon. all this without even mentioning the humiliation the united states with iran treatment our ten captured sailors negotiation, you must willing walk. the iran deal, like many our worst agreements the result not being willing leave the table. when the other side knows you not going walk becomes absolutely impossible win the same time, your friends need know that you will stick the agreements that you have with them. president obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic supported the ouster friendly regime egypt that had longstanding peace treaty with israel  and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood power its place. israel, our great friend and the one true democracy the middle east, has been snubbed and criticized administration that lacks moral clarity. just few days ago, vice president biden again criticized israel force for justice and peace  for acting impediment peace the region. president obama has not been friend israel has treated iran with tender love and care and made great power the middle east  all the expense israel, our other allies the region and, critically, the united states picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they starting look elsewhere for help. fourth, our rivals longer respect fact, they are just confused our allies, but even bigger problem that they don take seriously any more. when president obama landed cuba air force one leader was there meet greet him  perhaps incident without precedent the long and prestigious history air force one. then, amazingly, the same thing happened saudi arabia called respect you remember when the president made long and expensive trip copenhagen, denmark get the olympics for our country, and, after this unprecedented effort was announced that the united states came fourth place should have known the result before making such embarrassing commitment. the list humiliations goes and. president obama watches helplessly north korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reach. our president has allowed china continue its economic assault american jobs and wealth, refusing enforce trade rules apply the leverage china necessary rein north korea has even allowed china steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage industrial espionage against the united states and its companies let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything president obama goal had been weaken america could not have done better job. finally, america longer has clear understanding our foreign policy goals. since the end the cold war and the break the soviet union lacked coherent foreign policy. one day bombing libya and getting rid dictator foster democracy for civilians, the next day are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apart humanitarian nation. but the legacy the obama-clinton interventions will weakness, confusion, and disarray have made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before left christians subject intense persecution and even genocide. our actions iraq, libya and syria have helped unleash isis. and war against radical islam, but president obama won even name the enemy! hillary clinton also refuses say the words ""radical islam,"" even she pushes for massive increase refugees. after secretary clinton failed intervention libya, islamic terrorists benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans. then, instead taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided home and sleep! incredible. clinton blames all video excuse that was total lie. our ambassador was murdered and our secretary state misled the nation  and the way, she was not awake take that call'clock the morning. and now isis making millions dollars week selling libyan oil. this will change when president all our friends and allies say america going strong again. america going reliable friend and ally again going finally have coherent foreign policy based upon american interests, and the shared interests our allies are getting out the nation-building business, and instead focusing creating stability the world. our moments greatest strength came when politics ended the water edge need new, rational american foreign policy, informed the best minds and supported both parties well our close allies. this how won the cold war, and how will win our new and future struggles. first need long-term plan halt the spread and reach radical islam. containing the spread radical islam must major foreign policy goal the united states. events may require the use military force. but also philosophical struggle, like our long struggle the cold war this going working very closely with our allies the muslim world, all which are risk from radical islamic violence should work together with any nation the region that threatened the rise radical islam. but this has two-way street  they must also good and remember and all are doing for them. the struggle against radical islam also takes place our homeland. there are scores recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. for every case known the public, there are dozens more must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies pause for reassessment will help prevent the next san bernardino worse -- all you have look the world trade center and september 11th. and then there isis have simple message for them. their days are numbered won tell them where and won tell them how must nation more unpredictable. but they going gone. and soon. secondly have rebuild our military and our economy. the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look what happened! our nuclear weapons arsenal  our ultimate deterrent  has been allowed atrophy and desperately need modernization and renewal. our active duty armed forces have shrunk from million 1991 about million today. the navy has shrunk from over 500 ships 272 ships during that time. the air force about smaller than 1991. pilots are flying-52s combat missions today which are older than most people this room. and what are doing about this? president obama has proposed 2017 defense budget that real dollars, cuts nearly% from what were spending 2011. our military depleted, and asking our generals and military leaders worry about global warming will spend what need rebuild our military the cheapest investment can make will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known mankind. our military dominance must unquestioned. but will look for savings and spend our money wisely this time mounting debt, not one dollar can wasted are also going have change our trade, immigration and economic policies make our economy strong again  and put americans first again. this will ensure that our own workers, right here america, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might nation need think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives edge. this includes printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare great country also takes care its warriors. our commitment them absolute trump administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support the world when they serve, and the best care the world when they return veterans civilian life. finally must develop foreign policy based american interests. businesses not succeed when they lose sight their core interests and neither countries. look what happened the 1990s. our embassies kenya and tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed the uss cole. and what did seemed put more effort into adding china the world trade organization  which has been disaster for the united states  than into stopping qaeda even had opportunity take out osama bin laden, and didn. and then got hit the world trade center and the pentagon, the worst attack our country its history. our foreign policy goals must based america core national security interests, and the following will priorities the middle east, our goals must defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change need clear-sighted about the groups that will never anything other than enemies. and must only generous those that prove they are our friends desire live peacefully and friendship with russia and china have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes. but are not bound adversaries should seek common ground based shared interests. russia, for instance, has also seen the horror islamic terrorism believe easing tensions and improved relations with russia  from position strength possible. common sense says this cycle hostility must end. some say the russians won reasonable intend find out can make good deal for america, then will quickly walk from the table. fixing our relations with china another important step towards prosperous century. china respects strength, and letting them take advantage economically have lost all their respect have massive trade deficit with china deficit must find way, quickly balance strong and smart america america that will find better friend china can both benefit can both our separate ways. after elected president will also call for summit with our nato allies, and separate summit with our asian allies these summits will not only discuss rebalancing financial commitments, but take fresh look how can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. for instance will discuss how can upgrade nato outdated mission and structure  grown out the cold war confront our shared challenges, including migration and islamic terrorism will not hesitate deploy military force when there alternative. but america fights must fight win will never send our finest into battle unless necessary  and will only have plan for victory. our goal peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. the best way achieve those goals through disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. with president obama and secretary clinton had the exact opposite reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy  one that has blazed path destruction its wake. after losing thousands lives and spending trillions dollars are far worse shape now the middle east than ever before challenge anyone explain the strategic foreign policy vision obama-clinton has been complete and total disaster will also prepared deploy america economic resources. financial leverage and sanctions can very persuasive  but need use them selectively and with determination. our power will used others not play the rules. our friends and enemies must know that draw line the sand will enforce. however, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not first instinct. you cannot have foreign policy without diplomacy superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs strength. although not government service was totally against the war iraq, saying for many years that would destabilize the middle east. sadly was correct, and the biggest beneficiary was iran, who systematically taking over iraq and gaining access their rich oil reserves  something has wanted for decades. and now top all off have isis goal establish foreign policy that will endure for several generations. that why will also look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little brag about except responsibility for long history failed policies and continued losses war. finally will work with our allies reinvigorate western values and institutions. instead trying spread ""universal values"" that not everyone shares should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will more inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. these are goals president will seek foreign policy that all americans, whatever their party, can support, and which our friends and allies will respect and welcome. the world must know that not abroad search enemies, that are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies achieve these goals, americans must have confidence their country and its leadership again. many americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested defending the borders foreign countries than their own. americans must know that are putting the american people first again trade immigration foreign policy  the jobs, incomes and security the american worker will always first priority country has ever prospered that failed put its own interests first. both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and, while being fair them, must the same will longer surrender this country its people the false song globalism. the nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony skeptical international unions that tie and bring america down, and will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability control our own affairs. nafta example, has been total disaster for the. and has emptied our states our manufacturing and our jobs. never again. only the reverse will happen will keep our jobs and bring new ones. their will consequences for companies that leave the. only exploit later. under trump administration american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second the citizens foreign countries will view the world through the clear lens american interests will america greatest defender and most loyal champion will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes who are. the world most peaceful, and most prosperous, when america strongest. america will continually play the role peacemaker will always help save lives and, indeed, humanity itself. but play that role must make america strong again must make america respected again. and must make america great again that, perhaps this century can the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known. thank you.

"thank you for joining today. this was going speech hillary clinton and how bad president, especially these times radical islamic terrorism, she would. even her former secret service agent, who has seen her under pressure and times stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity president. there will plenty opportunity discuss these important issues later time, and will deliver that speech soon. but today there only one thing discuss: the growing threat terrorism inside our borders. the attack the pulse nightclub orlando, florida, was the worst terrorist strike our soil since september 11th, and the worst mass shooting our country history many people dead many people gravely injured much carnage, such disgrace. the horror beyond description. the families these wonderful people are totally devastated. likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world devastated express our deepest sympathies the victims, the wounded, and their families mourn one people, for our nation loss  and pledge our support any and all who need would like ask now that all observe moment silence for the victims the attack. silence our nation stands together solidarity with the members orlando lgbt community. this very dark moment america history radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because wanted kill americans, but order execute gay and lesbian citizens because their sexual orientation strike the heart and soul who are nation assault the ability free people live their lives, love who they want and express their identity attack the right every single american live peace and safety their own country need respond this attack america one united people  with force, purpose and determination. but the current politically correct response cripples our ability talk and think and act clearly don get tough, and don get smart  and fast not going have country anymore -- there will nothing left. the killer, whose name will not use ever say, was born afghan parents who immigrated the united states. his father published support for the afghan taliban regime which murders those who don share its radical views. the father even said was running for president that country. the bottom line that the only reason the killer was america the first place was because allowed his family come here. that fact, and fact need talk about have dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit know who let into our country, and does not permit protect our citizens have incompetent administration, and not elected president, that will not change over the next four years -- but must change, and must change now. with fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded cannot afford talk around the issue anymore have address head called for ban after san bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying was right -- and although the pause temporary must find out what going. the ban will lifted when nation are position properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country. the immigration laws the united states give the president the power suspend entry into the country any class persons that the president deems detrimental the interests security the united states deems appropriate will use this power protect the american people. when elected will suspend immigration from areas the world when there proven history terrorism against the united states, europe our allies, until understand how end these threats. after full, impartial and long overdue security assessment will develop responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values america cannot continue allow thousands upon thousands people pour into our country, many whom have the same thought process this savage killer. many the principles radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions. radical islam anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-american refuse allow america become place where gay people, christian people, and jewish people, are the targets persecution and intimidation radical islamic preachers hate and violence not just national security issue quality life issue want protect the quality life for all americans  women and children, gay and straight, jews and christians and all people  then need tell the truth about radical islam need tell the truth, also, about how radical islam coming our shores are importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through failed immigration system -- and through intelligence community held back our president. even our own fbi director has admitted that cannot effectively check the backgrounds the people are letting into america. all the september 11th hijackers were issued visas. large numbers somali refugees minnesota have tried join isis. the boston bombers came here through political asylum. the male shooter san bernardino  again, whose name won mention -- was the child immigrants from pakistan, and brought his wife  the other terrorist - from saudi arabia, through another one our easily exploited visa programs. immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five-fold just one year. according pew research people afghanistan support oppressive sharia law admit many more from other countries the region who share these same oppressive views want remain free and open society, then have control our borders. yet, hillary clinton  for months and despite many attacks  repeatedly refused even say the words ""radical islam,"" until challenged her yesterday say the words leave the race. however, hillary clinton  who has been forced say the words today after policies she supports have caused much damage  still has clue what radical islam, and won speak honestly about what. she total denial, and her continuing reluctance ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world fact, just few weeks before the san bernardino slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal say the words radical islam. here what she said: ""muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever with terrorism."" hillary clinton says the solution ban guns. they tried that france, which has among the toughest gun laws the world, and 130 were brutally murdered islamic terrorists cold blood. her plan disarm law-abiding americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. she wants take away americans' guns, then admit the very people who want slaughter will meeting with the nra, which has given their earliest endorsement presidential race discuss how ensure americans have the means protect themselves this age terror. the bottom line that hillary supports the policies that bring the threat radical islam into america, and allow grow overseas fact, hillary clinton catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way life. when comes radical islamic terrorism, ignorance not bliss deadly. the obama administration, with the support hillary clinton and others, has also damaged our security restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing support law enforcement. they have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else refuse politically correct will the right thing want straighten things out and make america great again. the days deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon president will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need prevent terrorist attacks need intelligence-gathering system second none. that includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials  and with our allies will have attorney general director national intelligence, and secretary defense who will know how fight the war radical islamic terrorism  and who will have the support they require get the job done also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need understand the threat. the senate subcommittee immigration has already identified hundreds immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th. nearly year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama departments justice, state and homeland security provide the immigration history all terrorists inside the united states. these departments refused comply. president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories all individuals implicated terrorist activity any kind since. the public has right know how these people got here have screen applicants know whether they are affiliated with support, radical groups and beliefs have control the amount future immigration into this country prevent large pockets radicalization from forming inside america. even single individual can devastating, just look what happened orlando. can you imagine large groups? truly, our president doesn know what doing has failed, and failed badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better will only get worse. each year, the united states permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the middle east, and many more from muslim countries outside the middle east. our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security fact, clinton state department was charge the admissions process for people applying enter from overseas. having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans massively increase admissions without screening plan, including 500% increase syrian refugees. this could better, bigger version the legendary trojan horse can let this happen. altogether, under the clinton plan, you admitting hundreds thousands refugees from the middle east with system vet them prevent the radicalization their children. the burden hillary clinton tell why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should increased without any effective system screen who are bringing. the burden hillary clinton tell why should admit anyone into our country who supports violence any kind against gay and lesbian americans. the burden also hillary clinton tell how she will pay for. her plan will cost americans hundreds billions dollars long-term. wouldn this money better spent rebuilding america for our current population, including the many poor people already living here have stop the tremendous flow syrian refugees into the united states don know who they are, they have documentation, and don know what they planning. what want common sense want mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values. that the choice put before the american people mainstream immigration policy designed benefit america hillary clinton radical immigration policy designed benefit politically-correct special interests got get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and got now, because later too late. ask yourself, who really the friend women and the lgbt community, donald trump with his actions hillary clinton with her words? clinton wants allow radical islamic terrorists pour into our countrythey enslave women, and murder gays don want them our country. the terrorist attack the pulse night club demands full and complete investigation into every aspect the assault san bernardino example, people knew what was going, but they used the excuse racial profiling for not reporting need know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates need know was affiliated with any radical mosques radical activists and what any their immigration status need know travelled anywhere, and who travelled with need make sure every single last person involved this plan  including anyone who knew something but didn tell brought justice can proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information authorities, they must serve prison time . america must more  much more protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims crimes based their backgrounds sexual orientations also means must change our foreign policy. the decision overthrow the regime libya, then pushing for the overthrow the regime syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis expand and grow. these actions, along with our disastrous iran deal, have also reduced our ability work partnership with our muslim allies the region. that why our new goal must defeat islamic terrorism, not nation-building. for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton war libya. that mission helped unleash isis new continent said nato needs change its focus stopping terrorism. since raised that criticism, nato has since announced new initiative focused just that. america must unite the whole civilized world the fight against islamic terrorism, just like did against communism the cold war tried president obama way gave the world his apology tour got isis, and many other problems return like conclude remarks today again expressing our solidarity with the people orlando who have come under attack. when president pledge protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders. wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all americans living here and following our laws will protected. america will tolerant and open society. america will also safe society will protect our borders home will defeat isis overseas will ensure every parent can raise their children peace and safety will make america rich again will make america safe again will make american great again. thank you. the media talks about ""homegrown,"" terrorism, but islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture, are imports from overseas. yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country result the poor policies the past. but the whole point that will much, much easier deal with our current problem don keep bringing people who add the problem. for instance, the controversial mosque attended the boston bombers had its founder immigrant from overseas charged assassination plot. this shooter orlando was the child immigrant father who supported one the most repressive regimes earth. why would admit people who support violent hatred? hillary clinton can never claim friend the gay community long she continues support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn share their views. she can have both ways. she can claim supportive these communities while trying increase the number people coming who want oppress them. how does this kind immigration make our life better? how does this kind immigration make our country better? why does hillary clinton want bring people here vast numberswho reject our values? immigration privilege, and should not let anyone into this country who doesn support our communities  all our communities. america has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country earth, and continue admit millions more with real checks scrutiny. not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven budged many years whether matter national security financial security can afford keep going like this owe trillion debt, and longer have options. all our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. this not act offense against anyone act defense want all work together, including partnership with our muslim communities. but muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn the people who they know are bad  and they know where they are want fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market want every american succeed. hillary clinton wants empty out the treasury bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens want protect our citizens  all our citizens.

"today like share thoughts about the stakes this election. people have asked why running for president have built amazing business that love and get work side-side with children every day come work together and turn visions into reality think big, and then make happen love what, and grateful beyond words the nation that has allowed when people ask why running quickly answer running give back this country which has been good. when see the crumbling roads and bridges the dilapidated airports the factories moving overseas mexico other countries know these problems can all fixed, but not hillary clinton  only. the fact can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --jobs, jobs, jobs! everywhere look see the possibilities what our country could. but can solve any these problems relying the politicians who created them will never able fix rigged system counting the same people who rigged the first place. the insiders wrote the rules the game keep themselves power and the money. that why asking bernie sanders' voters join our movement together can fix the system for all americans. importantly, this includes fixing all our many disastrous trade deals. because not just the political system that rigged the whole economy rigged big donors who want keep down wages rigged big businesses who want leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the. with absolutely consequences for them rigged bureaucrats who are trapping kids failing schools rigged against you, the american people. hillary clinton who most people know world class liar  just look her pathetic email and server statements her phony landing bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out young girls handing her flowers total self-serving lie. brian williams' career was destroyed for saying far less. yesterday, she even tried attack and many businesses. but here the bottom line started off brooklyn new york, not long ago, with small loan and built business worth over billion dollars have always had talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. that talent our country desperately needs running for president end the unfairness and put you, the american worker, first are going put america first, and are going make america great again. this election will decide whether are ruled the people the politicians. here promise the american voter elected president will end the special interest monopoly washington. the other candidate this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests  and taking money from special interests. hillary clinton has perfected the politics personal profit and theft. she ran the state department like her own personal hedge fund  doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others exchange for cash. then, when she left, she made million giving speeches wall street banks and other special interests less than years  secret speeches that she does not want reveal the public. together, she and bill made $153 million giving speeches lobbyists, ceos, and foreign governments the years since 2001. they totally own her, and that will never change. the choice this election choice between taking our government back from the special interests surrendering our last scrap independence their total and complete control. those are the stakes. hillary clinton wants president. but she doesn have the temperament bernie sanders' said, the judgement president. she believes she entitled the office. her campaign slogan with her."" you know what response that with you: the american people. she thinks all about her know all about you know all about making america great again for all americans. our country lost its way when stopped putting the american people first got here because switched from policy americanism  focusing what good for america middle class policy globalism, focusing how make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers foreign countries all the detriment the american worker and the american economy reward companies for offshoring, and punish companies for doing business america and keeping our workers employed. this not rising tide that lifts all boats. this wave globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs need reform our economic system that, once again can all succeed together, and america can become rich again. that what mean america first. our country will better off when start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back our shores. our founders understood this. one the first major bills signed george washington called for ""the encouragement and protection manufacturing america. our first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned saying: ""the abandonment the protective policy the american government will produce want and ruin among our people have visited the cities and towns across america and seen the devastation caused the trade policies bill and hillary clinton. hillary clinton supported bill clinton disastrous nafta, just like she supported china entrance into the world trade organization lost nearly one-third our manufacturing jobs since these two hillary-backed agreements were signed. our trade deficit with china soared% during hillary clinton time secretary state disgraceful performance for which she should not congratulated, but rather scorned. then she let china steal hundreds billions dollars our intellectual property crime which continuing this day. hillary clinton gave china millions our best jobs, and effectively let china completely rebuild itself return, hillary clinton got rich! the book clinton cash peter schweitzer, documents how bill and hillary used the state department enrich their family america expense. she gets rich making you poor. here quote from the book the center policy toward china was hillary clinton this critical time for-china relations, bill clinton gave number speeches that were underwritten the chinese government and its supporters."" these funds were paid the clinton bank account while hillary was negotiating with china behalf the united states. she sold out our workers, and our country, for beijing. hillary clinton has also been the biggest promoter the trans-pacific partnership, which will ship millions more our jobs overseas  and give congressional power international foreign commission. now, because have pointed out why would such disastrous deal, she pretending that she against. she has even deleted this record total support from her book  deletion something she very good least,000 emails are missing. but this latest clinton cover doesn change anything she elected president, she will adopt the trans-pacific partnership, and will lose millions jobs and our economic independence for good. she will this, just she has betrayed the american worker trade every single stage her career  and will even worse than the clintons' nafta deal want trade deals, but they have great for the united states and our workers don make great deals anymore, but will once become president not just our economy that been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. the hillary clinton foreign policy has cost america thousands lives and trillions dollars  and unleashed isis across the world secretary state has been more wrong, more often, and more places than hillary clinton. her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. among the victims our late ambassador, chris stevens was left helpless die hillary clinton soundly slept her bed -- that right, when the phone rang'clock the morning, she was sleeping. ambassador stevens and his staff libya made hundreds requests for security. hillary clinton state department refused them all. she started the war that put him libya, denied him the security asked for, then left him there die cover her tracks, hillary lied about video being the cause his death. here what one the victim mothers had say want the whole world know: she lied face, and you don want this person president 2009, before hillary clinton was sworn was different world. libya was cooperating. iraq was seeing reduction violence. syria was under control. iran was being choked sanctions. egypt was governed friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with israel. isis wasn even the map. fast forward 2013 just four years, secretary clinton managed almost single-handedly destabilize the entire middle east. her invasion libya handed the country over the isis barbarians. thanks hillary clinton, iran now the dominant islamic power the middle east, and the road nuclear weapons. hillary clinton support for violent regime change syria has thrown the country into one the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen  while giving isis launching pad for terrorism against the west. she helped force out friendly regime egypt and replace with the radical muslim brotherhood. the egyptian military has retaken control, but clinton has opened the pandora box radical islam. then, there was the disastrous strategy announcing our departure date from iraq, handing large parts the country over isis killers. isis threatens today because the decisions hillary clinton has made. isis also threatens peaceful muslims across the middle east, and peaceful muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized horrible brutality  and who only want raise their kids peace and safety short, hillary clinton tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another all started with her bad judgment supporting the war iraq the first place. though was not government service was among the earliest criticize the rush war, and yes, even before the war ever started. but hillary clinton learned nothing from iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn wait rush off war libya. she lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence lead the words secret service agent posted outside the oval office: ""she simply lacks the integrity and temperament serve the office from the bottom soul know this true her leadership style  volcanic, impulsive disdainful the rules set for everyone else  hasn changed bit."" perhaps the most terrifying thing about hillary clinton foreign policy that she refuses acknowledge the threat posed radical islam fact, hillary clinton supports radical 550% increase syrian refugees coming into the united states, and that increase over president obama already very high number. under her plan would admit hundreds thousands refugees from the most dangerous countries earth  with way screen who they are what they believe. already, hundreds recent immigrants and their children have been convicted terrorist activity inside the. the father the orlando shooter was taliban supporter from afghanistan, one the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes earth only want admit people who share our values and love our people. hillary clinton wants bring people who believe women should enslaved and gays put death. maybe her motivation lies among the more than,000 foreign donations hillary failed disclose while the state department. hillary clinton may the most corrupt person ever seek the presidency. here some more what learned from the book, clinton cash foreign telecom giant faced possible state department sanctions for providing technology iran, and other oppressive regimes what did this company? for the first time ever, they decided pay bill clinton $750,000 for single speech. the clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.hillary clinton state department approved the transfer america uranium holdings russia, while investors the deal funneled $145 million the clinton foundation.hillary clinton appointed top donor national security board with top secret access  even though had national security credentials.hillary clinton accepted,000 jewelry from the government brunei when she was secretary state  plus millions more for her foundation. the sultan brunei has pushed oppressive sharia law, including the punishment death stoning for being gay. the government brunei also stands one the biggest beneficiaries hillary trans-pacific partnership, which she would absolutely approve given the chance. hillary clinton took million from saudi arabia, where being gay also punishable death.hillary took millions from kuwait, qatar, oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and lgbt citizens cover her corrupt dealings, hillary clinton illegally stashed her state department emails private server. her server was easily hacked foreign governments  perhaps even her financial backers communist china  putting all america danger. then there are the,000 emails she deleted. while may not know what those deleted emails, our enemies probably they probably now have blackmail file over someone who wants president the united states. this fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency can hand over our government someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may the hands our enemies. national security also immigration security  and hillary wants neither. hillary clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform the history the united states. she has pledged grant mass amnesty and her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders the united states. the first victims her radical policies will poor african-american and hispanic workers who need jobs. they are the ones she will hurt the most. let share with you letter our campaign received from mary ann mendoza. she lost her amazing son, police sergeant brandon mendoza, after was killed illegal immigrant because the open borders policies supported hillary clinton. sadly, the mendoza family just one thousands who have suffered the same fate. here excerpt from mrs. mendoza letter: ""hillary clinton, who already has the blood many her hands now announcing that she willing put each and every one our lives harms' way open door policy criminals and terrorists enter our country. hillary not concerned about you, she only concerned about the power the presidency would bring her. she needs prison pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."" hillary also wants spend hundreds billions resettle middle eastern refugees the united states top the current record level immigration. for the amount money hillary clinton would like spend refugees could rebuild every inner city america. hillary wall street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed americans out work. she can claim care about african-american and hispanic workers when she wants bring millions new low-wage workers compete against them. here are few things trump administration will for america the first 100 days:appoint judges who will uphold the constitution. hillary clinton radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.change immigration rules give unemployed americans opportunity fill good-paying jobsstand countries that cheat trade which there are manycancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseaslift restrictions energy productionrepeal and replace job-killing obamacare disaster.pass massive tax reform create millions new jobs.impose tough new ethics rules restore dignity the office secretary state. there one common theme all these reforms going america first. this why the stakes november are great election day, the politicians stand trial before the people. the voters are the jury. their ballots are the verdict don need want another clinton obama. come november, the american people will have chance issue verdict the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country. they will have chance vote for new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the american people. hillary clinton message old and tired. her message that can change message that things have change  and this our one chance. this our last chance. americans are the people that tamed the west, that dug out the panama canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and much more. then started thinking small stopped believing what america could, and became reliant other countries, other people, and other institutions lost our sense purpose, and daring. but that not who are. come this november can bring america back  bigger and better, and stronger than ever will build the greatest infrastructure the planet earth  the roads and railways and airports tomorrow. our military will have the best technology and finest equipment will bring back all the way. massive new factories will come roaring into our country  breathing life and hope into our communities. inner cities, which have been horribly abused hillary clinton and the democrat party, will finally rebuilt. construction what know -- nobody knows better. the real wages for our workers have not been raised for years -- but these wages will start going, along with the new jobs. hillary massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone are also going supporting our police and law enforcement can never forget the great job they also going appoint great supreme court justices. our country going start working again. people are going start working again. parents are going start dreaming big for their children again  including parents our inner cities. americans are going start believing the future our country are going make america rich again are going make america safe again are going make america great again 

she made million giving speeches wall street banks and other special interests less than years secret speeches that she does not want reveal the public together she and bill made million giving speeches lobbyists ceos and foreign governments the years since 001 they totally own her and that will never change the choice this election choice between taking our government back from the special

judgement president she believes she entitled the office her campaign slogan with her you know what response that with you the american people she thinks all about her know all about you know all

out our middle class and our jobs need reform our economic system that once again can all succeed together and america can become rich again that what mean america first our country will better off when start making our own products again bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back our shores our founders understood this one the first major bills signed george washington called for the encouragement and protection manufacturing america our first republican president abraham lincoln warned saying the abandonment the protective policy the american government will produce want and ruin among our people have visited the cities and towns across america and seen the devastation caused the trade policies bill and hillary clinton hillary clinton supported bill clinton disastrous nafta just like she supported china entrance into the world trade organization lost nearly one third our manufacturing jobs since these two hillary backed agreements were signed our trade deficit with china soared during hillary clinton time secretary state disgraceful performance for which she should not congratulated but rather scorned then she let china steal hundreds billions dollars our intellectual property crime which continuing this day hillary clinton gave china millions our best jobs and effectively let china completely rebuild itself return hillary clinton got rich the book clinton cash peter schweitzer documents how bill and hillary used the state department enrich their family america expense she gets rich making you poor here quote from the book the center policy toward china was hillary clinton this critical time for china relations bill clinton gave number speeches that were underwritten the chinese government and its supporters these funds were paid the clinton bank account while hillary was negotiating with china behalf the united states she sold out our workers and our country for beijing hillary clinton has also been the biggest promoter the trans pacific partnership which will ship millions more our jobs overseas and give congressional power international foreign commission now because have pointed out why would such disastrous deal she pretending that she against she has even deleted this record total support from her book deletion something she very good least 000 emails are missing but this latest clinton cover doesn change anything she elected president she will adopt the trans pacific partnership and will lose millions jobs and our economic independence for good she will this just she has betrayed the american worker trade every single stage her career and will even worse than the clintons nafta deal want trade deals but they have great for the united states and our workers don make great deals anymore but will once become president not just our economy that been corrupted but our foreign policy too the hillary clinton foreign policy has cost america thousands lives and trillions dollars and unleashed isis across the world secretary state has been more wrong more often and more places than hillary clinton her decisions spread death destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched among the victims our late ambassador chris stevens was left helpless die hillary clinton soundly slept her bed that right when the phone rang clock the morning she was sleeping ambassador stevens and his staff libya made hundreds requests for security hillary clinton state department refused them all she started the war that put him libya denied him the security asked for then left him there die cover her tracks hillary lied about video being the cause his death here what one the victim mothers had say want the whole world know she lied face and you don want this person president before hillary clinton was sworn was different world libya was cooperating iraq was seeing reduction violence syria was under control iran was being choked sanctions egypt was governed friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with israel isis wasn even the map fast forward just four years secretary clinton managed almost single handedly destabilize the entire middle east her invasion libya handed the country over the isis barbarians thanks hillary clinton iran now the dominant islamic power the middle east and the road nuclear weapons hillary clinton support for violent regime change syria has thrown the country into one the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen while giving isis launching pad for terrorism against the west she helped force out friendly regime egypt and replace with the radical muslim brotherhood the egyptian military has retaken control but clinton has opened the pandora box radical islam then there was the disastrous strategy announcing our departure date from iraq handing large parts the country over isis killers isis threatens today because the decisions hillary clinton has made isis also threatens peaceful muslims across the middle east and peaceful muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized horrible brutality and who only want raise their kids peace and safety short hillary clinton tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another all started with her bad judgment supporting the war iraq the first place though was not government service was among the earliest criticize the rush war and yes even before the war ever started but hillary clinton learned nothing from iraq because when she got into power she couldn wait rush off war libya she lacks the temperament the judgment and the competence lead the words secret service agent posted outside the oval office she simply lacks the integrity and temperament serve the office from the bottom soul know this true her leadership style volcanic impulsive disdainful the rules set for everyone else hasn changed bit perhaps the most terrifying thing about hillary clinton foreign policy that she refuses acknowledge the threat posed radical islam fact hillary clinton supports radical increase syrian refugees coming into the united states and that increase over president obama already very high number under her plan would admit hundreds thousands refugees from the most dangerous countries earth with way screen who they are what they believe already hundreds recent immigrants and their children have been convicted terrorist activity inside the the father the orlando shooter was taliban supporter from afghanistan one the most repressive anti gay and anti women regimes earth only want admit people who share our values and love our people hillary clinton wants bring people who believe women should enslaved and gays put death maybe her motivation lies among the more than 000 foreign donations hillary failed disclose while the state department hillary clinton may the most corrupt person ever seek the presidency here some more what learned from the book clinton cash foreign telecom giant faced possible state department sanctions for providing technology iran and other oppressive regimes what did this company for the first time ever they decided pay bill clinton 000 for single speech the clintons got their cash the telecom company escaped sanctions hillary clinton state department approved the transfer america uranium holdings russia while investors the deal funneled million the clinton foundation hillary clinton appointed top donor national security board with top secret access even though had national security credentials hillary clinton accepted 000 jewelry from the government brunei when she was secretary state plus millions more for her foundation the sultan brunei has pushed oppressive sharia law including the punishment death stoning for being gay the government brunei also stands one the biggest beneficiaries hillary trans pacific partnership which she would absolutely approve given the chance hillary clinton took million from saudi arabia where being gay also punishable death hillary took millions from kuwait qatar oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and lgbt citizens cover her corrupt dealings hillary clinton illegally stashed her state department emails private server her server was easily hacked foreign governments perhaps even her financial backers communist china putting all america danger then there are the 000 emails she deleted while may not know what those deleted emails our enemies probably they probably now have blackmail file over someone who wants president the united states this fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency can hand over our government someone whose deepest darkest secrets may the hands our enemies national security also immigration security and hillary wants neither hillary clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform the history the united states she has pledged grant mass amnesty and her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders the united states the first victims her radical policies will poor african american and hispanic workers who need jobs they are the ones she will hurt the most let share with you letter our campaign received from mary ann mendoza she lost her amazing son police sergeant brandon mendoza after was killed illegal immigrant because the open borders policies supported hillary clinton sadly the mendoza family just one thousands who have suffered the same fate here excerpt from mrs mendoza letter hillary clinton who already has the blood many her hands now announcing that she willing put each and every one our lives harms way open door policy criminals and terrorists enter our country hillary not concerned about you she only concerned about the power the presidency would bring her she needs prison pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country hillary also wants spend hundreds billions resettle middle eastern refugees the united states top the current record level immigration for the amount money hillary clinton would like spend refugees could rebuild every inner city america hillary wall street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed americans out work she can claim care about african american and hispanic workers when she wants bring millions new low wage workers compete against them here are few things trump

"thank you like thank chairman jeff miller for his leadership behalf those who have served this country military uniform, and for working with our campaign developing real solutions for our great veterans. before going further today, however would first like address the contributions another group who serve this country uniform: the men and women blue. our police officers rush into danger every day protect our communities, and they often thanklessly and under relentless criticism. they save thousands lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear single headline media report. but want our nation police know, that thank you, and support you, and will always stand with you. the attack our dallas police attack our country. our whole nation mourning, and will for very long time. yet also seen increasing threats against our police and substantial rise the number officers killed the line duty. america police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos  and the destruction our country know must remember, the police are needed the most where crime the highest. politicians and activists who seek remove police policing from community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable americans time for the hostility against our police, and against all members law enforcement end  and end right now went through ugly chapter our history, during vietnam, when our troops became the victims harassment and political agendas. for too many police today, that their daily reality the same time, the tragic deaths louisiana and minnesota make clear the work that must done ensure every american feels that their safety protected were all disturbed the images saw must discuss well, the ongoing catastrophe crime our inner cities. according the chicago tribune, there has already been more than,000 shooting victims chicago this year alone. this epidemic violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young americans. violent crime has increased cities across america. the new york times described startling rise murders our major cities. brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into virginia and maryland. too many americans are trapped fear, violence and poverty. our inner cities have been left behind, and going fight make sure every citizen this country has safe home, safe school and safe community must maintain law and order the highest level will cease have country the law and order candidate. hillary clinton the other hand weak, ineffective, pandering, and proven her recent email scandal, which was embarrassment not only her, but the nation whole, she either liar grossly incompetent. personally think she both. not only the law and order candidate, but also the candidate compassion. but you can have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens the united states. every kid america should able securely walk the streets their own neighborhood. everyone will protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice will tough will smart will fair  and will protect all americans. without safety have nothing the job the next president make america safe again  for everyone. that promise protection must include taking care every last veteran, which was going the sole topic today speech prior the attack dallas. the men and women who have served our armed forces represent the very best america. now the time follow their example unity, public service and selfless devotion our country made promise these heroes. you defend america, and america will defend you. but that promise has been broken our politicians, like many other promises our country has made  not only its veterans, but its citizens whole. president obama has allowed our veterans affairs health care system deny help and support those who deserve most. hillary clinton recently said the scandal that not been widespread has been made out."" she actually thinks that the veterans health administration well run  that because she has been part the rigged system. perhaps easy for politicians lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions dollars read speeches wall street executives  instead spending time with real people real pain. the disconnect america deep. there are two americas: the ruling class, and the groups favors, and then everyone else. the scandals that have occurred this administration watch are widespread and inexcusable internal memo from senior official describes ""lawlessness and chaos the veterans health administration, including the payments billion year violation federal contracting rules. the memo also says they ""waste millions dollars paying excessive prices due breaches federal laws"" and warns that ""these unlawful acts may potentially result serious harm death america veterans."" even the white house own deputy chief staff described ""significant and chronic systemic failures veterans affairs, including corrosive culture that has led personnel problems across the department,"" with ""poor management,"" and history retaliation toward employees raising issues said there ""lack accountability across all grade levels."" here are just few examples: --forty veterans died waiting for care phoenix. --forty different facilities nationwide were found manipulating and falsifying wait times employee who was involved armed robbery was kept staff was convicted sex offender. --the spent million solar panels for facility knowing they would likely need torn down. --the. cloud, minn built million wind turbine april 2011 that hasn supplied power since 2012. can you imagine the waste and corruption find when begin full investigation january 2017? most those responsible have still not been held account. fixing this corruption will one highest priorities  and will happen will fixed. that begins with simple promise: every veteran will get timely access top-quality care veterans should guaranteed the right choose their doctor and clinics, whether facility private medical center must extend this right all veterans not just those who can get appointment days who live more than miles from hospital, which the current policy. this promise includes guaranteed access the best available healthcare services for our female veterans must also more help our veterans find jobs every year, large corporations bring many thousands low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border fill jobs that could easily filled our veterans. veterans should come first the country they fought protect, and under trump administration they will -- america first, veterans first. veterans' health care must also include the best mental health care shocking veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older veterans. this national tragedy. the evidence shows that veterans are the system, receiving care, they are much less likely take their own lives than veterans outside the system. that why must increase the number mental health care professionals inside the  while ensuring that veterans can access private mental health care well. america must take action improve mental health services for the country large. this includes expanding the number facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making easier for family members who see warning signs get their loved ones the care they need  especially emergencies. one the most important reforms can make accountability right now, when employees fail our veterans, you can discipline them. that because outdated civil service rules need reform fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions 2014, the awarded $142 million bonuses its employees, including bonuses the executives who oversaw construction the denver hospital that was more than billion over budget. two other executives even abused their authority obtain $400,000 relocation benefits doesn have this way veteran affairs chairman jeff miller said: ""the not sacred. the veteran."" here step plan ensure quality, timely care for every veteran america: one will appoint secretary veterans affairs who will make his her personal mission clean the. the secretary sole mandate will serve our veterans  not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans. amazingly, president obama secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times saying that people also wait line disneyland. two going use every lawful authority remove and discipline federal employees managers who fail our veterans breach the public trust. three going ask congress pass legislation that ensures the secretary veterans affairs has the authority remove discipline any employee who risks the health, safety well-being any veteran. four going appoint commission investigate all the wrongdoing the and then present those findings congress the basis for bold legislative reform. five going make sure the honest and dedicated people the have their jobs protected, and are put line for promotions. six will create private white house hotline  that answered real person hours day ensure that valid complaint about wrongdoing falls through the cracks will instruct staff that valid complaint not addressed that the issue brought directly, and will pick the phone and fix myself need. that promise. seven are going stop giving bonuses people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste employee finds smart way save large amount money that also creates better outcomes for our veterans, then small, responsible portion the money saved will given one-time bonus and the rest will returned taxpayers. eight are going reform our visa programs ensure american veterans are the front, not back the line. nine are going increase the number mental health care professionals, and increase outreach veterans outside the system. ten are going ensure every veteran america has the choice seek care the seek private medical care paid for our government. never again will allow veteran suffer die waiting for the care they richly deserve need clean out the corruption government, and hillary clinton will never able she incompetent, and has proven that time and time again. crooked hillary clinton the secretary the status quo  and wherever hillary clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow. our country needs change, and she will never give change. the fact, she helped create our rigged system. hillary clinton america country where the elite get one standard treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment. the rigged system refused prosecute her for conduct that put all america risk. hillary clinton went great lengths create private email server and bypass government security order keep her emails from being read the public and federal officials other words, she was willing risk our foreign enemies reading her emails long the voting american public could not. her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful  and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware her guilt. this was not just extreme carelessness with classified material  which still totally disqualifying. this calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct  followed cover that included false statements and lies congress, the media and the american people fact, when the fbi interviewed her for only hours during the 4th july weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath. she carried out her dangerous email scheme the same time her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing isis across the world. afterwards further demonstration guilt, hillary clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails part the cover. the fact that she got away with all this could her single most impressive accomplishment. when thinking about her-mail destruction, let not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before hillary clinton state department were making massive financial contributions. these contributions were made both the clinton foundation and the clintons directly elected, hillary clinton would become the first president the united states who wouldn able pass background check. just look what the fbi director said about her  her misconduct disgrace and embarrassment our country. clearly, hillary clinton thinks she above the law. come november, the american people will show her that she not. the decades decay, division and decline will come end. the years american greatness will return are going become, for the first time long time, one united country are going make american great again  and safe again  for all americans will dream big and bold and daring things once more. let conclude paying tribute every single american hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. our debt them eternal and everlasting are going fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for will safe, strong, and proud country once again. thank you.

daughter was just one more american life that wasn worth protecting more. one more child sacrifice the order and the altar open borders. what about our economy? again will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out your nightly news and your morning newspaper: nearly four african-american children are living poverty, while african american youth are now not employed million more latinos are poverty today than when president obama took his oath office less than eight years ago. another million people have left the workforce entirely. household incomes are down more than,000 since the year 2000. our trade deficit goods -- think this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone going fix that. the budget better. president obama has doubled our national debt more than trillion, and growing. and yet, what have show for? our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are third world condition, and forty-three million americans are food stamps. now let consider the state affairs abroad. not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. one after another all remember the images our sailors being forced their knees their iranian captors gunpoint. this was just prior the signing the iran deal, which gave back iran $150 billion and gave absoltely nothing will down history one the worst deals ever negotiated. another humiliation came when president obama drew red line syria  and the whole world knew meant absolutely nothing libya, our consulate  the symbol american prestige around the globe  was brought down flames. america far less safe  and the world far less stable  than when obama made the decision put hillary clinton charge america foreign policy. let defeat her november certain decision president obama truly regrets. her bad instincts and her bad judgment  something pointed out bernie sanders  are what caused many the disasters unfolding today. let review the record 2009, pre-hillary, isis was not even the map.libya was stable. egypt was peaceful. iraq was seeing big, big reduction violence. iran was being choked sanctions. syria was somewhat under control. after four years hillary clinton, what have? isis has spread across the region, and the world. libya ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless die the hands savage killers. egypt was turned over the radical muslim brotherhood, forcing the military retake control. iraq chaos. iran the path nuclear weapons. syria engulfed civil war and refugee crisis now threatens the west. after fifteen years wars the middle east, after trillions dollars spent and thousands lives lost, the situation worse than has ever been before. this the legacy hillary clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. but hillary clinton legacy does not have america legacy. the problems face now  poverty and violence home, war and destruction abroad  will last only long continue relying the same politicians who created them the first place change leadership required produce change outcomes. tonight will share with you plan action for america. the most important difference between our plan and that our opponents that our plan will put america first. americanism, not globalism, will our credo long are led politicians who will not put america first, then can assured that other nations will not treat america with respect, the respect deserve. the american people will come first once again plan will begin with safety home  which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. there can prosperity without law and order the economy will outline reforms add millions new jobs and trillions new wealth that can used rebuild america number these reforms that will outline tonight will opposed some our nation most powerful special interests. that because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. believe for their benefit. big business, elite media and major donors are lining behind the campaign opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system place. they are throwing money her because they have total control over every single thing she does. she their puppet, and they pull the strings. that why hillary clinton message that things will never change...never ever message that things have change  and they have change right now. every day wake determined deliver for the people have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed our horrible and unfair trade deals. these are the forgotten men and women our country. and they are forgotten, but they not going forgotten long. people who work hard but longer have voice your voice have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. disruption the audience how great are our police? and how great cleveland have patience for injustice tolerance for government incompetence sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. when innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will the courage the basic decency enforce our laws still worse still, has sold out some corporate lobbyist for cash not able look the other way, and won look the other way. and when secretary state illegally stores her emails private server, deletes,000 them the authorities can see her crime, puts our country risk, lies about every different form and faces consequence know that corruption has reached level like never ever before our country. when the fbi director says that the secretary state was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent handling our classified secrets also know that these terms are minor compared what she actually did. they were just used save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes fact, her single greatest accomplishment may committing such egregious crime and getting away with  especially when others who have done far less, have paid dearly. when that same secretary state rakes millions and millions dollars trading access and favors special interests and foreign powers know the time for action has come have joined the political arena that the powerful can longer beat people that cannot defend themselves. nobody knows the system better than, which why alone can fix have seen firsthand how the system rigged against our citizens, just like was rigged against bernie sanders never had chance. but his supporters will join our movement, because will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our jobs, and strip our wealth country. millions democrats will join our movement because are going fix the system works justly for each and every american this cause proud have side the next vice president the united states: governor mike pence indiana. and great guy will bring the same economic success america that mike brought indiana, which amazing man character and accomplishment the man for the job. the first task for our new administration will liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. america was shocked its core when our police officers dallas were brutally executed the days after dallas have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. law officers have been shot killed recent days georgia, missouri, wisconsin, kansas, michigan and tennessee sunday, more police were gunned down baton rouge, louisiana. three were killed, and three were very very badly injured attack law enforcement attack all americans have message every last person threatening the peace our streets and the safety our police: when take the oath office next year will restore law and order our country. believe, believe will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials get the job properly done this race for the white house the law and order candidate. the irresponsible rhetoric our president, who has used the pulpit the presidency divide race and color, has made america more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly have ever seen and anybody this room has ever watched seen. this administration has failed america inner cities. remember has failed america inner cities failed them education failed them jobs failed them crime failed them every level. when president will work ensure that all our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. every action take will ask myself: does this make better for young americans baltimore chicago detroit ferguson who have much right live out their dreams any other child america? any other child make life safe america must also address the growing threats face from outside the country are going defeat the barbarians isis, and are going defeat them fast. once again, france the victim brutal islamic terrorism. men, women and children viciously mowed down. lives ruined. families ripped apart nation mourning. the damage and devastation that can inflicted islamic radicals has been proven over and over the world trade center office party san bernardino the boston marathon, and military recruiting center chattanooga, tennessee. and many, many other locations. only weeks ago orlando, florida wonderful americans were savagely murdered islamic terrorist. this time, the terrorist targeted lgbtq community good and going stop your president will everything power protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression hateful foreign ideology  beleive. and republican nice hear you cheering for what just said. thank you protect from terrorism need focus three things must have the best intelligence gathering operation the world must abandon the failed policy nation building and regime change that hillary clinton pushed iraq, libya, egypt and syria. instead must work with all our allies who share our goal destroying isis and stamping out islamic terrorism and doing now, doing quickly going win going win fast. this includes working with our greatest ally the region, the state israel. recently have said that nato was obsolete, because did not properly cover terror, and also, that many the member countries were not paying their fair share usual, the united states has been picking the cost. shortly thereafter was announced that nato will setting new program order combat terrorism true step the right direction. lastly, and very importantly must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised terrorism until such time proven vetting mechanisms have been put place don want them our country opponent has called for radical 550% increase syrian -- think this. think this. this not believable, but this what happening -- refugees top existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under president obama. she proposes this despite the fact that there way screen these refugees order find out who they are where they come from only want admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. anyone who endorses violence, hatred oppression not welcome our country and never ever will. decades record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for african-american and latino workers are going have immigration system that works, but one that works for the american people monday heard from three parents whose children were killed illegal immigrants mary ann mendoza, sabine durden, and friend jamiel shaw. they are just three brave representatives many thousands who have suffered gravely all travels this country, nothing has affected more deeply than the time have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children violence spilling across our border, which can solve have solve. these families have special interests represent them. there are demonstrators protest their behalf opponent will never meet with them share their pain, believe. instead opponent wants sanctuary cities. but where was sanctuary for kate steinle? where was sanctuary for the children mary ann, and sabine, and jamiel? where was sanctuary for all the other sad even talking about because can fix this problem quickly -- americans who have been brutally murdered, and who have suffered horribly? these wounded american families have been alone. but they are alone longer. tonight, this candidate

border crossings will down will stop won happening very much anymore. believe. peace will restored enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve. tonight want every american whose demands for immigration security have been denied  and every politician who has denied them listen very very closely the words about say january 20th 2017, the day take the oath office, americans will finally wake country where the laws the united states are enforced are going considerate and compassionate everyone. but greatest compassion will for our own struggling citizens plan the exact opposite the radical and dangerous immigration policy hillary clinton. americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. communities want relief. yet hillary clinton proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make harder for recent immigrants escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they going through right now and make almost impossible join the middle class have different vision for our workers begins with new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands countries that cheat which there are many been signature message campaign from day one, and will signature feature presidency from the moment take the oath office have made billions dollars business making deals  now going make our country rich again. using the richest people the world, which our country has going turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. america has lost nearly-one third its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment disastrous trade deals supported bill and hillary clinton. remember was bill clinton who signed nafta, one the worst economic deals ever made our country, frankly, any other country. never, ever again going bring our jobs back ohio and pennsylvania and new york and michigan and all america  and not going let companies move other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. not going happen anymore opponent the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. she supported nafta, and she supported china entrance into the world trade organization  another one her husband colossal mistakes and disasters. she supported the job killing trade deal with south korea. she has supported the trans-pacific partnership. the tpp will not only destroy our manufacturing, but will make america subject the rulings foreign governments. and not going happen pledge never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers that diminishes our freedom and independence will never, ever sign bad trade deals. america fist, again! america first! instead will make individual deals with individual countries longer will enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands pages long  and which one from our country even reads understands are going enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats. this includes stopping china outrageous theft intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. they are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! our horrible trade agreements with china and many others, will totally renegotiated. that includes renegotiating nafta get much better deal for america  and walk away don get the deal that want are going start building and making things again. next comes the reform our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. while hillary clinton plans massive -- and mean massive -- tax increase have proposed the largest tax reduction any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year  democrat republican. middle-income americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will greatly simplified for everyone, and mean everyone. america one the highest-taxed nations the world. reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs come roaring back into our country. believe will happen, and will happen fast. then are going deal with the issue regulation, one the greatest job-killers them all. excessive regulation costing our country much trillion year, and will end very very quickly are going lift the restrictions the production american energy. this will produce more than trillion job creating economic activity over the next four decades opponent the other hand, wants put the great miners and steel workers our country out work and out business  that will never happen with donald

""you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor."" really? how many people have been able keep the doctor their plan? keep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks disaster the way going repealed and replaced 100 percent.  and -- and honestly hope win, because will great job are going make america great again going make america great again.  but actually think that regardless who wins, obamacare going fold any event expensive. people can afford and the country can afford. other than that just wonderful texas, they just had almost percent increase. now the increases are starting come out. the big increase going announced november 1st. the election november 8th. folks, they want delay, because election-changing mess election changing, and they want change. and can let that happen. because the numbers -- and can see some the numbers already -- the numbers are going astronomical. they are going astronomical. they going big horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan terrible terrible. and going take care everybody, but going end with great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country. this plan total rip does not work going fall, because economically disaster for the country, too. but what about people where they said they had percent increase? and going worse than that predict november 1st better get smart and better start thinking properly. now want talk about what going the borders, because money going build, listen have people coming our country that should not coming our country have thousands and thousands people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts the world that are allowing come into our country. most the politicians, almost all them don even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people. this could the great trojan horse all time. and hillary wants thousands more come over and above obama. right, tall -- and the wall getting taller every day you think this just wrote this, the obama-clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions iraq, libya and syria isis. huge portions has undermined stability egypt, and you know what they have over there. and empowered iran never before. iran, three years ago was -- was dying fact, when they were marching the streets obama would have just encouraged them little more would have been taken over the people. but obama played ball with the thugs that are running right now. think this, think this. look, look making deal, and the deal not made, and they are dancing the streets iran saying how stupid the americans are making this deal. the leaders, and particular the leader iran calling stupid, and the deal means nothing. and yesterday think just said that the united states essentially nothing. this our -- this our great, great partner. but when you have somebody was making this deal, and the other side was bragging about, the deal wasn made not making that deal not making walking. but kept going, and should have never ever started negotiating that deal until had our hostages back should have walked should have doubled the sanctions and walked. and they would have -- and say. before the plane reached new york city washington, you could just turn around, because they call you, they say, let. take your hostages. but when you think about, you probably read today and yesterday, one the hostages was waiting for very long period time. now, obama said that had nothing with the hostages. that would not that for kidnappers would not that for kidnapping, think that. you have got think about wouldn -- now was the same day, right, same day have exactly accurate, because they catch, right? same day. the money came, and one the hostages good guy saw him interview television. good guy, hard time. btu didn say waited forever waited. and somebody said, nope are waiting for either something plane come. and here obama stands yesterday, and for seven minutes telling one thing had nothing with the other. just lie. you know least truthful.  and talking about the same day, $400 million, and could have had something that would have been much better deal. and you know what all favor deals when gets nuclear. but could have made should have walked. and should have walked with $150, too have said, sorry don have the money, can pay don have the money owe almost trillion sorry, fellas love you think you the greatest guys earth. but can give you the money don have. and they will get angry and they will upset, and two days later, you back negotiating. you just saved yourself $150 billion, right? hundred and -- $150 billion have terrorists pouring into our country have people coming don know you saw this maine -- and maine knows, because maine was there yesterday great place great governor, great governor. paul doing great job. and think the most important issue facing civilization right now radical islamic terrorism. and have president that refuses use the term, and have crooked hillary who does not want use. now, she being forced use. did you notice she gave speech, she said will use. she called think, radical islam. but she said will use will. just like the trans-pacific partnership. she called the gold standard horror show almost bad maybe going worse than nafta, signed her husband, which cleaned out many the states our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing. moved mexico and other places. nafta total disaster. nafta, signed bill clinton never suffered the ravages, because signed, then got out and other people did suffer with. but are going renegotiate nafta, and they don want make great deal for get our jobs back least lot them can make great deal -- and she can that the way she wanted. number one, her donors would not let her. her special interests would never let her. her lobbyists would never let her. number three, she could not anyway. even she wanted. but going renegotiate. and did you hear her the other day? after years saying how wonderful, even though you look new england, and you look new york state and you look pennsylvania and ohio you look lot other places, one the reasons won indiana big -- well, one the reasons was the great bobby knight? bobby knight indiana.  that gold standard right she said about tpp. but one the reasons won was because carrier air conditioning was moving mexico from indiana, and they let,400 people. and been talking about this, and know how stop, and you heard before easy stop. there have consequences when mexico takes our companies. and not only mexico; there have consequences when china devalues its currency that our companies can longer compete with china, even though make better product have friends who are manufacturers make better product. they can get their product into china and when few times arise where they can, they have pay incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs. but yet open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and lose our jobs and very, very said. but look many know major destination -- maine, has become major destination for somali refugees admit hundreds thousands refugees into the united states from many the most dangerous and unstable regions the world. and you are getting them here too folks, you just don know because you just don know. anybody this room -- anybody this room from terror territory? all right practice -- and this practice which will continue under hillary clinton except will expand five, six, seven fold don get mean know they will vote democrat, that what know, but they will not voting for long time just don get, how can anybody even think this way? now, the washington times reported the somali refugees -- the program minnesota -- that the effort resettle large groups somali refugees having the unintended consequence creating enclave immigrants with high unemployment that both stressing the state safety net"" -- tremendous problems for safety -- ""and creating rich pool potential recruiting targets for the islamic terror groups aren smart are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs. here are some the examples will give you few examples, and this came out the senate subcommittee just recently. ""the boston bombers"" -- remember those horrible, disgusting people? ""the boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process. the younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized september, 2012. the older brother had pending application for citizenship."" and look what happened took them. look what happened, aren smart?

foreign policy has handed huge portions iraq libya and syria isis huge portions has undermined stability egypt and you know what they have over there and empowered iran never before iran three years ago was was dying fact when they were marching the streets obama would have just encouraged them little more would have been taken over the people but obama played ball with the thugs that are running right now think this think this look look making deal and the deal not made and they are dancing the streets iran saying how stupid the americans are making this deal the leaders and particular the leader iran calling stupid and the deal means nothing and yesterday think just said that the united states essentially nothing this our this our great great partner but when you have somebody was making this deal and the other side was bragging about the deal wasn made not making that deal not making walking but kept going and should have never ever started negotiating that deal until had our hostages back should have walked should have doubled the sanctions and walked and they would have and say before the plane reached new york city washington you could just turn around because they call you they say let take your hostages but when you think about you probably read today and yesterday one the hostages was waiting for very long period time now obama said that had nothing with the

"thank you for the invitation speak you today wonderful detroit now begin great national conversation about economic renewal for america conversation about how make american great again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least. the city detroit where our story begins detroit was once the economic envy the world. the people detroit helped power america its position global dominance the 20th century. when were governed america first policy, detroit was booming. engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the american dream. but for many living this city, that dream has long ago vanished. when abandoned the policy america first started rebuilding other countries instead our own. the skyscrapers went beijing, and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled detroit. our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet found the money resettle millions refugees taxpayer expense. today, detroit has per capita income under,000 dollars, about half the national average percent the city residents live poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. the unemployment rate more than twice the national average. half all detroit residents not work. detroit tops the list most dangerous cities terms violent crime—these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told hillary clinton, but victims whose suffering less real permanent short, the city detroit the living, breathing example opponent failed economic agenda. every policy that has failed this city, and many others policy supported hillary clinton. she supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out your community and the crime policies that have made you less safe and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like nafta, signed her husband, that have shipped your jobs mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. she the candidate the past. ours the campaign the future. this city controlled democratic politicians every level, and unless change policies will not change results. today will outline economic vision the coming weeks will offering more detail all these policies, and the ones have already rolled out can viewed campaign website. our opposition the other hand, has long ago run out ideas. all hillary clinton has offer more the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions american energy and american production you were foreign power looking weaken america, you couldn better than hillary clinton economic agenda. nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out existence. the one common feature every hillary clinton idea that punishes you for working and doing business the united states. every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries our expense. that why she tries distract with tired political rhetoric that seeks label, divide, and pull apart campaign about reaching out everyone americans, and returning government that puts the american people first. here what america first economic plan looks like. first, let talk tax reform. taxes are one the biggest differences this race. hillary clinton—who has spent her career voting for tax increases—plans another massive job-killing trillion-dollar tax increase. her plan would tax many small businesses almost fifty percent. recently campaign event, hillary clinton short-circuited again use now famous term—when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted raise taxes the middle class proposing across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income americans. this will lead millions new good-paying jobs. the rich will pay their fair share, but one will pay much that destroys jobs undermines our ability compete part this reform will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been good for wall street investors, and people like, but unfair american workers. tax simplification will major feature the plan. our current tax code burdensome and complex that waste billion hours year tax code compliance plan will reduce the current number brackets from, and dramatically streamline the process will work with house republicans this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed and percent. for many american workers, their tax rate will zero. while will develop our own set assumptions and policies, agreeing some areas but not others will focused the same shared goals and guided the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. these reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the reagan tax reform, which unleashed years continued economic growth and job creation will make america grow again the days ahead will provide more details this plan and how will help you and your family will present night-and-day contrast the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing obama-clinton agenda. the state new york has already lived through hillary clinton failed leadership. the washington post just published devastating article hillary clinton broken promises. she pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate new york senator. but what happened? the washington post writes, and quote: ""upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly percent the former first lady was unable pass big ticket legislation many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated other states she turned her first presidential run data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during clinton first term."" compare that record recent new york post article steve cuozzo, ""how donald trump helped save new york city,"" the paper writes that—and this direct quote—""waded into landscape empty fifth avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was central park and wall street area seemingly its last legs companies moved out almost force will rode the rescue. expressing rare faith the future was instrumental kick-starting the regeneration neighborhoods and landmarks almost given for dead."" this what want for our country want jumpstart america. now let look what the obama-clinton policies have done nationally. their policies produced% growth, the weakest-called recovery since the great depression, and doubling the national debt. there are now million americans outside the labor force was million when president obama took office increase nearly million people. the obama-clinton agenda tax, spend and regulate has created silent nation jobless americans. home ownership its lowest rate years. nearly million have been added the food stamp rolls since president obama took office. another nearly million americans were added the ranks those poverty have the lowest labor force participation rates four decades percent african-american youth are either outside the labor force not employed american households not have single member the labor force. these are the real unemployment numbers—the five percent figure one the biggest hoaxes modern politics. meanwhile, american households are earning more than,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. the average worker today pays percent their wages income and payroll taxes top that, state and local taxes consume another percent. the united states also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations the world percent almost percent when you add taxes the state level other words punish companies for making products america—but let them ship products into the. tax-free they move overseas. this backwards. all our policies should geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the united states. under plan american company will pay more than their business income taxes. small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. hillary clinton plan will require small business pay much three times more taxes than what proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out business going cut regulations massively. our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions new dollars and wealth come pouring into our country—and into cities like detroit help unleash this new job creation will allow businesses immediately expense new business investments one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income americans plan will also help reduce the cost childcare allowing parents fully deduct the average cost childcare spending from their taxes are also going bring back trillions dollars from american businesses that now parked overseas. our plan will bring that cash home, applying percent tax. this money will-invested states like michigan. finally family will have pay the death tax. american workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not taxed again death just plain wrong will repeal. next comes regulatory reform with taxes will have one overriding goal when comes regulation want keep jobs and wealth america. motor vehicle manufacturing one the most heavily regulated industries the country. the. economy today twenty-five percent smaller than would have been without the surge regulations since 1980 estimated that current overregulation costing our economy much trillion dollars year—that money taken straight out cities like yours. the federal register now over,000 pages long the wall street journal noted, president obama has issued close four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with cost the american economy $100 million more 2015 alone, the obama administration unilaterally issued more than,000 new regulations—each hidden tax american consumers, and massive lead weight the american economy time remove the anchor dragging down. upon taking office will issue temporary moratorium new agency regulations running mate, mike pence, signed similar order when became governor indiana. this will give our american companies the certainty they need reinvest our community, get cash off the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. next will ask each and every federal agency prepare list all the regulations they impose americans which are not necessary not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. those regulations will eliminated are competition with the world, and want america win. when president will. one the most important reforms all trade reform bernie sanders has said, hillary clinton has bad judgment seen this bad judgment overseas libya, iraq, and syria seen iran seen from president obama, when gives $150 billion iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million money-laundered cash ransom payment. but also seen the terrible obama-clinton judgment right here detroit. hillary clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country its jobs and wealth. she supported bill clinton nafta, she supported china entrance into the world trade organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with south korea, and she supports the trans-pacific partnership. let talk about south korea for moment, because perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt many american workers. president obama, and the usual-called experts who been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with south korea would increase our exports south korea more than billion—resulting some,000 jobs. like hillary clinton broken promises new york, these pledges all turned out false. instead creating,000 jobs has killed nearly 100,000, according the economic policy institute. our exports south korea haven increased all, but their imports have surged more than billion—more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. the next betrayal will the trans-pacific partnership. hillary clinton closest friend, terry mcauliffe, confirmed what have said this from the beginning sent the oval office, hillary clinton will enact the tpp. guaranteed. her donors will make sure vote for hillary clinton vote for tpp—and also vote for nafta. our annual trade deficit goods with mexico has risen from close zero 1993 almost billion. our total trade deficit goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. this strike the heart michigan, and our nation whole. according the bureau labor statistics, before nafta went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers michigan. today, that number only 160,000. detroit still waiting for hillary clinton apology expect detroit will get that apology right around the same time hillary clinton turns over the,000 emails she deleted. hillary clinton trans-pacific partnership tpp will even bigger disaster for the auto industry fact, ford motor company has announced its opposition the deal. according the economic policy institute, the. trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over million manufacturing jobs 2015 far the biggest losses occurred motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. michigan ranks first for jobs lost share state workforce due the trade deficit with tpp members. just imagine how many more automobile jobs will lost the tpp actually approved. that why have announced will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. hillary clinton will never withdraw from the tpp. she bought, controlled and paid-for her donors and special interests. because only interest the american people have previously laid out detailed-point plan for trade reform, available website includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat unfairly subsidizing their goods, and includes renegotiation nafta don get better deal will walk away the center plan trade enforcement with china. this alone could return millions jobs into our economy. china responsible for nearly half our entire trade deficit. they break the rules every way imaginable. china engages illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft intellectual property. they also have real environmental labor protections, further undercutting american workers. just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions american jobs. according the. international trade commission, improved protection america intellectual property china would produce more than million more jobs right here the united states. add that the saved jobs from cracking down currency cheating and product dumping, and will bring trillions dollars new wealth and wages back the united states. trade has big benefits, and favor trade. but want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for american workers. isolation not option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are. also critical our economic renewal will energy reform the obama-clinton administration has blocked and destroyed millions jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price electricity for both families and businesses result recent obama epa actions coal-fired power plants across

expense that why she tries distract with tired political rhetoric that seeks label divide and pull apart campaign about reaching out everyone americans and returning government that puts the american people first here what america first economic plan looks like first let talk tax reform taxes are one the biggest differences this race hillary clinton who has spent her career voting for tax increases plans another massive job killing trillion dollar tax increase her plan would tax many small businesses almost fifty percent recently campaign event hillary clinton short circuited again use now famous term when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted raise taxes the middle class proposing across the board income tax reduction especially for middle income americans this will lead millions new good paying jobs the rich will pay their fair share but one will pay much that destroys jobs undermines our ability compete part this reform will eliminate the carried interest

unleashed years continued economic growth and job creation will make america grow again the days ahead will provide more details this plan and how will help you and your family will present night and day contrast the job killing tax raising poverty inducing obama clinton agenda the state new york has already lived through hillary clinton failed leadership the washington post just published devastating article hillary clinton broken promises she pledged 000 jobs for upstate new york senator but what happened the washington post writes and quote upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly percent the former first lady was unable pass big ticket legislation many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated other states she turned her first presidential run data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during clinton first term compare that record recent new york post article steve cuozzo how donald trump helped save new york city the paper writes that and this direct quote waded into landscape empty fifth avenue storefronts the dust bowl mugging ground that was central park and wall street area seemingly its last legs companies moved out almost force will rode the rescue expressing rare faith the future was instrumental kick starting the regeneration neighborhoods and landmarks almost given for dead this what want for our country want jumpstart america now let look what the obama clinton policies have done nationally their policies produced growth the weakest called recovery since the great depression and doubling the national debt there are now million americans outside the labor force was million when president obama took office increase nearly million people the obama clinton agenda tax spend and regulate has created silent nation jobless americans home ownership its lowest rate years nearly million have been added the food stamp rolls since president obama took office another nearly million americans were added the ranks those poverty have the lowest labor force participation rates four decades percent african american youth are either outside the labor force not employed american households not have single member the labor force these are the real unemployment numbers the five percent figure one the biggest hoaxes modern politics meanwhile american households are earning more than 000 less today than they were sixteen years ago the average worker today pays percent their wages income and payroll taxes top that state and local taxes consume another percent the united states also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations the world percent almost percent when you add taxes the state level other words punish companies for making products america but let them ship products into the tax free they move overseas this backwards all our policies should geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the united states under plan american company will pay more than their business income taxes small businesses will benefit the most from this plan hillary clinton plan will require small business pay much three times more taxes than what proposing and her onerous regulations will put them totally out business going cut regulations massively our lower business tax will also end job killing corporate inversions and cause trillions new dollars and wealth come pouring into our country and into cities like detroit help unleash this new job creation will allow businesses immediately expense new business investments one will gain more from these proposals than low and middle income americans plan will also help reduce the cost childcare allowing parents fully deduct the average cost childcare spending from their taxes are also going bring back trillions dollars from american businesses that now parked overseas our plan will bring that cash home applying percent tax this money will invested states like michigan finally family will have pay the death tax american workers have paid taxes their whole lives and they should not taxed again death just plain wrong will repeal next comes regulatory reform with taxes will have one overriding goal when comes regulation want keep jobs and wealth america motor vehicle manufacturing one the most heavily regulated industries the country the economy today twenty five percent smaller than would have been without the surge regulations since estimated that current overregulation costing our economy much trillion dollars year that money taken straight out cities like yours the federal register now over 000 pages long the wall street journal noted president obama has issued close four hundred new major regulations since taking office each with cost the american economy 100 million more alone the obama administration unilaterally issued more than 000 new regulations each hidden tax american consumers and massive lead weight the american economy time remove the anchor dragging down upon taking office will issue temporary moratorium new agency regulations running mate mike pence signed similar order when became governor indiana this will give our american companies the certainty they need reinvest our community get cash off the sidelines start hiring for new jobs and expanding businesses will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders next will ask each and every federal agency prepare list all the regulations they impose americans which are not necessary not improve public safety and which needlessly kill jobs those regulations will eliminated are competition with the world and want america win when president will one the most important reforms all trade reform bernie sanders has said hillary clinton has bad judgment seen this bad judgment overseas libya iraq and syria seen iran seen from president obama when gives billion iran the number one terror state and even gives them million money laundered cash ransom payment but also seen the terrible obama clinton judgment right here detroit hillary clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city and this country its jobs and wealth she supported bill clinton nafta she supported china entrance into the world trade organization she supported the job killing trade deal with south korea and she supports the trans pacific partnership let talk about south korea for moment because perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt many american workers president obama and the usual called experts who been wrong about every trade deal for decades predicted that the trade deal with south korea would increase our exports south korea more than billion resulting some 000 jobs like hillary clinton broken promises new york these pledges all turned out false instead creating 000 jobs has killed nearly 100 000 according the economic policy institute our exports south korea haven increased all but their imports have surged more than billion more than doubling our trade deficit with that country the next betrayal will the trans pacific partnership hillary clinton closest friend terry mcauliffe confirmed what have said this from the beginning sent the oval office hillary clinton will enact the tpp guaranteed her donors will make sure vote for hillary clinton vote for tpp and also vote for nafta our annual trade deficit goods with mexico has risen from close zero almost billion our total trade deficit goods hit nearly billion last year this strike the heart michigan and our nation whole according the bureau labor statistics before nafta went into effect there were 000 auto workers michigan today that number only 000 detroit still waiting for hillary clinton apology expect detroit will get that apology right around the same time hillary clinton turns over the 000 emails she deleted hillary clinton trans pacific partnership tpp will even bigger disaster for the auto industry fact ford motor company has announced its opposition the deal according the economic policy institute the trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over million manufacturing jobs far the biggest losses occurred motor vehicles and parts which lost nearly 000 manufacturing jobs michigan ranks first for jobs lost share state workforce due the trade deficit with tpp members just imagine how many more automobile jobs will lost the tpp actually approved that why have announced will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen hillary clinton will never withdraw from the tpp she bought controlled and paid for her donors and special interests because only interest the american people have previously laid out detailed point plan for trade reform available website includes strong protections against currency manipulation tariffs against any countries that cheat unfairly subsidizing their goods and includes renegotiation nafta don get better deal will walk away the center plan trade enforcement with china this alone could return millions jobs into our economy china responsible for nearly half our entire trade deficit they break the rules every way imaginable china engages illegal export subsidies prohibited currency manipulation and rampant theft intellectual property they also have real environmental labor protections further undercutting american workers just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions american jobs according the international trade commission improved protection america intellectual property china would produce more than million more jobs right here the united states add that the saved jobs from cracking down currency cheating and product dumping and will bring trillions dollars new wealth and wages back the united states trade has big benefits and favor trade but want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for american workers isolation not option only great and well crafted trade deals are also critical our economic renewal will energy reform the obama clinton administration has blocked and destroyed millions jobs through their anti energy regulations while raising the price electricity for both families and businesses result recent obama epa actions coal fired power plants across michigan have either shut down entirely undergone expensive conversions the obama clinton war coal has cost michigan over 000 jobs hillary clinton says her plan will put lot coal companies and coal miners out business will put our coal miners and steel workers back work clinton not only embraces president obama job killing

have repercussions? with, they have repercussions?  with, they have repercussions.  with inform them that you move, you gonna pay percent tax every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders.  and two things are gonna happen, one two things -- one two things are gonna happen. number one you get them time, they not moving. throws all off-balance, since they all off-kilter. number one they not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn anybody use this? why doesn anybody mention tell you why. because they controlled their lobbyists, they politicians. and carrier goes out whoever might this just using carrier example. its hundreds and thousands. its thousands company. and millions jobs talking about was looking numbers not gonna repeat the numbers because they say was wrong can that high couldn believe was that high. but thousands companies and millions and millions jobs. and you say why aren -- like, why doesn somebody else say what trump saying controlled myself because putting money putting money.  but... although raised, did you see million last month million last month?  and lot lot the money was the small donations which republicans never get lot them think averaged hit can you imagine that? the total that raised and fact may told you was taking heat because they said donald trump didn raise any money. and they told you why, right didn raise because didn know gotta make sure got the nomination didn get the nomination would gone turnberry and played golf? laughter scotland. but you know what got the nomination now had start. and raised million june, right lot small donations and raised million july. people are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate trump -- they said, that amazing doing all right. and people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message. because this message this important message. but when you say -- and when you hear what just said -- you charge tariff tax. and guess what? and people said why hasn the -- why haven the politicians, they smart, why haven they done? because they controlled people that work for many these companies and they not gonna. whether donors whether its special interests lobbyists they control because they want happen. and honestly think total disgrace think total disgrace for the millions jobs, and for the thousands and thousands companies that have left our country were here speak every one those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye. they were quiet. you know like the hillary protesters. you know why? they nice and quiet. the bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. right? the hillary protesters had spirit. did you see that? she starts screaming and the guy walks."" laughter the bernie ones were -- they had lot more spirit think going get lot bernie voters you want know the truth. because they understand that trade killing. trade few things few other facts wrote, which think are amazing. one the percent lowest, you know, forget. that not recovery probably much -- don forget, when they announced percent, that means lower. and starting set records. the national debt almost trillion trillion! the national debt under obama has doubled. think, doubled. might think the time gets out going more than double, but again have very accurate because say -- they say, well hasn quite doubled. believe the time gets out will have more than doubled. the national debt has doubled. and you know the bad part about that? you think the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would great, our country would great shape have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. you see where like percent the bridges are danger this country. and the roadways are mess have friend the trucking business said, you know, for years had problem. now buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because the potholes the highways and things that never had, you think with all that doubling the national debt, you really think that good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right not very bad shape. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion. nearly million americans their prime earning years are out the labor force, right the last seven years, another million people have left the work force. think. these are the real numbers, not the percent nonsense. you know, you look for job, you can find your job, you home, you share, you your parents, you your friends, you whatever. you gave, and now you considered -- statistically, you considered employed. those people are not employed; these are great people. and there are plenty them here mean have great people have the most loyal people have the smartest people. you know many people, they smart. they like say, well, trump don know got this right -- let tell you have the smartest people have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working have the smartest people put among -- some couldn say all, right -- against any that have deal with the last seven years million. one five american households not have single member the workforce. pretty bad. homeownership -- this one that amazing -- today, homeownership its lowest rate years you own homes mean always used the dream own home, right? the american home. lowest that its been many years years. nearly million people and more americans are dependent food stamps and million more latino americans live poverty under obama and clinton -- under obama; because clinton just gonna carry. you know don know you saw gave massive tax decrease yesterday regulations gonna get rid many them. but clinton gonna double your taxes; she gonna double your taxes. and she trying say well don know like trump way -- she gonna double your taxes. you gonna have massive tax increases clinton gets. enjoy -- enjoy folks that happens. fifty eight percent african american youth are not employed. how sad that? american households are earning,000 less -- listen this one, today -- than they were years ago. many workers are earning less than 1970 real dollars 1970 -- that long time ago, right? they earning real dollars less money under plan gonna create millions new and really good paying jobs. you know interesting because even the pro-obama people say about the jobs that they bad jobs heard from many the people. they trying defend him. but they say they bad jobs, they not good jobs. the good jobs -- the good jobs have left. but create millions new good paying jobs but good jobs. that important, that important.  everyone taxes will down. hillary clinton has supported tax increases the middle class for her entire career. she voted for higher taxes, 235 times the senate. that all thought was more than that, 235 times hope there not decimal point there times. but don think there -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times the senate. now, she planning another job killing trillion tax increase, that what her tax increase gonna, folks. like you not paying enough, right? her plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already deep trouble out business. then have will make -- and this important, this was ivanka trump daughter great great gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families.  and just many, many other things mean gonna make some unbelievable changes and easy. again, you know regulations traveling all over and meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work the businesses, they being laid off because. regulations told you -- and surprised, this probably the biggest surprise you have small business and said, you can have one the other major tax cut like gonna -- you know bringing down percent from more than -- much more than double that. but told you that you could have massive tax decrease really substantially -- but real way -- cut regulations hundred percent the people talk would take the regulation you could only have one the other amazing, its amazing and that surprised. surprised you too?  surprised him, too hundred percent mean, everybody -- businesses can form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden incredible that you can form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are existence are being put out existence for regulations that don anything want safety regulations want environmental regulations not, you know, people that don want these things have have that want clear air want clean water want clear water. but -- but that -- and there are certain things that you want, but that, you don have destroy our country and destroy our businesses you know just wrote this down today. hillary wants raise taxes comparison want lower them. hillary wants expand regulations, which she does big league. can you believe that will reduce them very, very substantially. could much percent.  hillary wants shut down energy production want expand.  lower electric -- lower electric bills, folks. hillary wants abolish -- essentially abolish the

slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some very, very, very bad shape today. france suffering gravely. and the tourism industry being massively affected the most negative way march this year terrorists detonated bomb brussels airport killing and injuring 340 people. this july the south france islamic terrorist turned his truck into instrument mass murder, plowing down and killing men, women and children and wounding 308 people. terrible. among the dead were two americans texas father and his-year-old son few weeks ago germany refugee armed with axe wounded people gruesome train attack. only days ago isis killer invaded christian church normandy, france forced- year-old priest his knees priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things. overseas isis has carried out absolute atrocity and one after another. children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. holy sites desecrated. christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. isis rounding what calls 'nation the cross', 'nation the cross campaign absolute and total genocide cannot let this evil continue.  thank you. thank you. nor can let the hateful ideology radical islam oppression women, gays, children and non-believers allowed reside spread within our own countries will defeat radical islamic terrorism just have defeated every threat faced every age and before. but will not will not, remember this, defeat with closed eyes silenced voices have president that doesn want say the words. anyone who cannot name our enemy not fit lead our country.  anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence radical islam lacks the moral clarity serve our president.  the rise isis the direct result policy decisions made president obama and secretary state clinton. let look back the middle east the very beginning 2009 before the obama-clinton administration took over. libya was stable. syria was under control. egypt was ruled secular president and ally the united states. iraq was experiencing reduction violence. the group that would become what now call isis was close being extinguished. iran was being choked off economic sanctions. fast forward today. what have--and think this--and the decisions made the obama/clinton group have been absolutely disastrous. libya ruins. our ambassador and three other really brave americans are dead. and isis has gained new base operations. syria the midst disastrous civil war. isis controls large portions territory refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states egypt, terrorists have gained foothold the sinai desert near the suez canal, one the most essential waterways the world. iraq chaos. and isis the loose. isis has spread across the middle east and into the west 2014, isis was operating seven nations. they were seven nations. terrible, but that what was. today they fully operational countries with aspiring branches six more for total. and many believe that number actually countries. they don even know. the situation likely worse than the public has any idea new congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth isis with percent analysts saying they had experience efforts manipulate their findings trying make look much better than bad the same time, isis trying infiltrate refugee flows into europe and the united states. iran, the world largest state sponsor terrorism not flush with $150 billion cash released the united states. plus you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million actual cash that was obviously used for ransom. worst all, the nuclear deal puts iran, the number one state sponsor radical islamic terrorism path nuclear weapons short, the obama/clinton foreign policy has unleashed isis, destabilized the middle east, and put the nation iran, which chants, ""death america dominant position regional power and fact aspiring dominant world power all began 2009 with what has become known president obama global apology tour all remember all remember. booing series speeches, president obama described america arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and colonial power was describing informed other countries that would speaking about america past errors pledged that would longer senior partner that sought dictate our terms lectured cia officers the need acknowledge their mistakes, and described guantanamo bay rallying cry for our enemies. perhaps speech was more misguided than president obama speech the muslim world, delivered cairo, egypt, 2009 remember well winning the cold war, president ronald reagan repeatedly touted the superiority freedom over communism and called the ussr the evil empire. yet when president obama delivered his address cairo such moral courage could found would found. instead condemning the oppression women and gays many muslim nations, and the systematic violations human rights the financing global terrorism, president obama tried draw equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs. the records are unbelievable and unmistakable. his naive words were followed even more naive actions. the failure establish new status forces agreement iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains that country and led directly the rise isis without question.  the failures iraq were compounded hillary clinton disaster, total disaster libya. president obama has since said that regrets, and really regrets, libya and the mistake made considers his worst mistake. according then-secretary defense robert gates, the invasion libya was nearly split decision, but hillary clinton forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. that why went. with one episode bad judgment after another, hillary clinton policies launched isis onto the world stage. yet she threw the middle east into violent turmoil, things turned out really not hot for our world and our country. the middle east particular. the clintons made almost,000 gross income while she was secretary state unbelievable. incident after incident proves again and again hillary clinton lacks the judgment said bernie sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character lead our nation.  importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina take isis and all the many adversaries face. not only terrorism, but trade and every other challenge must confront turn our great country around now time for new approach. our current strategy nation- building and regime-change proven, absolute failure have created the vacuums that allow terrorism grow and thrive was opponent the iraq war from the beginning major difference between and opponent. though was private citizen whose personal opinions such matters were really not sought nonetheless publicly expressed private doubts about the invasion was against, believe. three months before the invasion said interview with neil cavuto whom offer best wishes for speedy recovery, that ""perhaps shouldn doing yet. and that the economy much bigger problem august 2004, very early, right after the conflict made detailed statement esquire magazine interview. here the quote full. ""look the war iraq and the mess would never have handled that way."" this was right after the invasion. ""does anybody really believe that iraq going wonderful democracy where people are going run down the voting box and gently put their ballot and the winner happily going and step and lead the country'mon then continued, ""two minutes after leave there going revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy this case, guy, will take over. and have weapons mass destruction which saddam hussein did not have. ""what was the purpose this whole thing? hundreds and hundreds young people killed. and what about the people coming back with arms and legs? not mention all fairness, the other side. the tremendous damage done. all those iraqi kids who been blown pieces. and turns out that all the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. all this death and destruction for nothing been clear for long time that should not have gone. but have been just clear saying what catastrophic mistake hillary clinton and president obama made with the reckless way which they pulled out. after had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains should have never made such sudden withdrawal timetable advertised our enemies. they said moving out, here our time, here our date. who would this but incompetent president qaeda iraq had been decimated. and obama and clinton gave new life and allowed spread all across the world that same token president obama and hillary clinton should have never attempted build democracy libya push for immediate regime change syria support the overthrow mubarak egypt. one more point this have long said that should have kept the oil iraq said over and over and over again. another area where judgment has been proven correct just said many times, virtually every time was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil. according cnn, isis made much $500,000 oil sales 2014 alone. that before they really got started. fueling and funding its reign terror had controlled the oil like said should could have prevented the rise isis iraq, both cutting off major source funding and through the presence. forces necessary safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for have the oil was saying this constantly and consistently whomever would listen said, ""keep the oil. keep the oil. keep the oil. don let somebody else get they had listened then would have had the economic benefits the oil which wanted use help take care the wounded soldiers and families those who died the war addition which thousands lives would have been saved. this proposal its very nature would have left soldiers place our assets would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply oil the old days, when won war the victor belonged the spoils.  instead, all got from iraq and our ventures the middle east, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. but time put the mistakes the past behind and chart new course become president, the era nation-building will brought very swift and decisive end.  thank you. our new approach--which must shared both parties america our allies overseas and our friends the middle east--must halt the spread radical islam. all actions should oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will our ally. very important. some don share this goal cannot always choose our friends but can never fail recognize our enemies president will call for international conference focused this goal will work side side with our friends the middle east, including our greatest ally israel will partner with king abdullah jordan and the president egypt, president sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology death that must extinguished will also work very closely with nato this new mission had previously said that nato was obsolete because failed deal adequately with terrorism. since comments, they have changed their policy and now have new division focused terror threats. very good. very, very good also believe that could find common ground with russia fight against isis. wouldn that good thing? wouldn that good thing?  they, too, have much stake the outcome syria, and have had their own battles with islamic terrorism just bad ours. they have big, big problem russia with isis administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations crush and destroy isis. international cooperation cut off their funding. expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. their recruiting taking place right now, and they setting records got stopped cannot allow the internet used recruiting tool and for other purposes our enemy must shut down their access this form communication, and must immediately--immediately.  unlike hilary clinton, who has risked many lives with her careless handling sensitive information administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are.  and the way, what happened with her,000-mails absolute disgrace the united states america often said that the great general douglas macarthur and the great general george patton would state shock they were alive today see the way president obama and hillary clinton tried recklessly announce their every move before happens. like they did iraq that the enemy can prepare and adapt. their enemy says, ""thank you."" the fight will not limited isis will decimate- qaeda. and will seek starve funding for iran-backed hamas and hezbollah important can use existing. security council resolutions apply new and even stronger sanctions. military, cyber and financial warfare will all necessary dismantle islamic terrorism. but must use ideological warfare well. very important. and they use, better than have ever even thought using them. but that will change. just won, just won the cold war part exposing the evils communism and the virtues free markets too must take the ideology radical islam. while opponent accepted millions dollars foundation donations from countries where being gay offense punishable prison death administration will speak out against the oppression women, gays and people different beliefs.  our administration would friend all moderate muslim reformers the middle east and will amplify their voices. this includes speaking out against the horrible practice honor killings, where women are murdered their relatives for dressing, marrying acting way that violates fundamentalist teachings. over,000 pakistani girls are estimated the victims honor killings their relatives each year. recently prominent pakistani social media star was strangled death her brother the charge dishonoring the family his confession, the brother took pride the murder and said, ""girls are born stay home and follow traditions."" shockingly, this tradition that has reached our own shores. one such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves iraqi immigrant who was sentenced years jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been ""too westernized defeat islamic terrorism must also speak our forcefully against hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism grow breeding ground terrible, terrible breeding ground new immigration policy needed immediately and well.  the common thread linking the major islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred our soil, the fort hood shooting, the boston bombing, the san bernardino attack, the orlando attack that they have involved immigrants the children immigrants. clearly, new screening procedures are needed review the. senate immigration subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism terrorism-related offenses between and 2014, and many more since then, and this year record for identification gotten worse, far worse also know that isis recruits refugees after their entrance into the country have seen with the somali refugee population minnesota. beyond terrorism have also seen france, foreign populations have brought their anti-semitic attitudes with them cologne, germany new years have seen the reports sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows. pew polling shows that many the countries from which draw large number immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty very, very common you don have the faith that they demand you have trump administration will establish clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining immigration, and will tough, and will even extreme should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people the cold war had ideological screening test. the time overdue develop new screening test for the threats face today call extreme vetting call extreme--extreme vetting. our country has enough problems don need more, and these are problems like never had before addition screening out all members the sympathizers must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country its principles who believe that sharia law should supplant american law.  those who not believe our constitution who support bigotry hatred will not admitted for immigration into our country.  only those who expect flourish our country, and embrace tolerant american society should issued visas put these new procedures place will have temporarily suspend immigration from some the most dangerous and volatile regions the world, that have history exporting terrorism, nor for! not for.  thank you. thank you soon take office will ask the state department and the department homeland security identify list regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions will stop processing visas from those areas until such time deemed safe resume, based new circumstances new procedures. the size current immigration flows are simply too large perform adequate screening admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the middle east every year . beyond that admit hundreds thousands temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds thousands don control the numbers can perform adequate screening. there way can take place contrast opponent wants increase--which unbelievable matter who you are, where you come from--wants increase the flow syrian refugees 550% over what they are now. boos the united states senate subcommittee immigration estimates that hillary plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations her first term , assuming cuts other refugee programs could get worse! this would additional all other non-refugee immigration. unbelievable numbers. unbelievable numbers. the subcommittee estimates her plan would impose lifetime cost roughly $400 billion when you include the cost healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the state department placement figures. think this: $400 billion short, hillary clinton wants america angela merkel. boos and you know what disaster this massive immigration has been germany and the people germany. crime has risen levels that one thought they would ever, ever see catastrophe have enough problems our country don need more. lastly will need restore common sense our security procedures. another common feature the past attacks that have occurred our soil that warning signs were totally ignored. the hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. almost every one them said practically big bold letters ""fraud"". and nobody saw. the russians warned about the boston bombers, here political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed the fbi. very sad. the female san bernardino shooter her her statements, and everything that she said: she was here fiancée visa, which most people have not even heard, from saudi arabia, and she wanted support very openly jihad online. these are the people taking neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs the floor, and other things--but didn warn authorities because they said they didn want accused racial profiling. now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. the shooter orlando reportedly celebrated his classroom after, too, was interviewed the fbi. his father native afghanistan, supported the oppressive taliban regime, and expressed anti-american views very strongly , and the way, was just seen sitting behind hillary clinton with big fat smile his face, all the way through her speech. boos obviously liked what she had say called: weakness, weakness called stupidity, and had.  the fort hood shooter delivered presentation room full mental health experts before the attacks which threw out one red flag after another even proclaimed that ""love death more then you love life"". not good. these warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense our society.  thank you. thank you. that why one first acts president will establish commission radical islam, which will include reformers voices the muslim community, who will hopefully work with want build bridges and erase divisions. the goal the commission will identify and explain the american public the core convictions and beliefs radical islam identify the warning signs radicalization, and expose the networks our society that support radicalization. this commission will used develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. and while should give hand our great police officers and law enforcement officials.  thank you. thank you will also keep open guantanamo bay and place renewed emphasis human intelligence. drone strikes will remain part our strategy, but will also seek capture high-value targets gain needed information dismantle their organizations.  foreign combatants will tried military commissions.  finally will pursue aggressive criminal immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support terrorism. there will consequences for those people. there will very serious consequences.  similar the effort take down the mafia, this will the understood mission every federal investigator and prosecutor the country accomplish goal, you must state mission. the support networks for radical islam this country will stripped out and removed, one-one, viciously necessary--viciously necessary. immigration offices will also have their powers restored. those have been taken away. those who are guests our country that are preaching hate will asked return home immediately and they don immediately will return them home make america safe again must work together again. our victory the cold war relied bipartisan and international consensus. that what must have defeat radical islamic terrorism.  but just like couldn defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists explaining its horrible evils can defeat radical islamic terrorism unless the exact same thing have explain that exists, and explain the difficulties have have leader that can that, and not have that now. but this also means that have promote the exceptional virtues our own way life have exceptional country exceptional way life. but being tread sick, sick people. and expecting that newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and the same. pride our institutions, our history and our values should taught parents and teachers and impressed upon all those that come into our society and want join our society.  assimilation not act hostility, but expression compassion. our system government and our american culture the best the world, and produce the best outcomes for all who adopt.  thank you. thank you. this approach will not only make safer, but bring closer together country. renewing the spirit americanism will help heal the divisions our country which there are many have divider president call him the great divider the thing best will emphasizing what have common, not what pulls apart. this pledge the american people your president will your single greatest champion will fight ensure that every american treated equally, protected equally and honored equally will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression all its ugly forms, and seek new future built our common culture and values one american people. only this way will make america great again, and safe again--for everyone. thank you very much, god bless you. thank you. thank you. thank you.

officers here this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice difficult times. the violence, riots and destruction that have taken place milwaukee assault the right all citizens live security and peace. law and order must restored must restored for the sake all, but most especially the sake those living the affected communities. the main victims these riots are law-abiding african-american citizens living these neighborhoods their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer result. there compassion tolerating lawless conduct. crime and violence attack the poor, and will never accepted trump administration. the narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now our current administration, and pushed opponent hillary clinton false one. the problem our poorest communities not that there are too many police, the problem that there are not enough police. more law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing what our country needs. just like hillary clinton against the miners, she against the police. you know, and know. those peddling the narrative cops racist force our society narrative supported with nod opponent  share directly the responsibility for the unrest milwaukee, and many other places within our country. they have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere america. everytime rush judgment with false facts and narratives  whether ferguson baltimore  and foment further unrest direct disservice poor african-american residents who are hurt the high crime their communities. during the last hours, while protestors have raged against the police here milwaukee, another were killed chicago and another were wounded. more than,600 people have been shot chicago since the beginning the year, and almost,000 killed president obama hometown area since his presidency began. how are serving these american victims attacking law enforcement officers? the war our police must end must end now. the war our police war all peaceful citizens who want able work and live and send their kids school safety. our job not make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. our job make life more comfortable for the african-american parent who wants their kids able safely walk the streets the senior citizen waiting for bus the young child walking home from school. for every one violent protestor, there are hundred moms and dads and kids that same city block who just want able sleep safely night opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim. hillary clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems the inner cities today, and vote for her vote for another generation poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities care too much about country let that happen all care too much about our country let that happen. good policing saves lives dear friend, rudy giuliani, knows thing two about this. the policies put into place rudy ultimately brought down crime percent and murder percent. think how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed. imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country democratic politicians hadn blocked their cities what rudy did new york city make sure deliver safe neighborhoods here milwaukee, and all across this country easy for hillary clinton turn blind eye crime when she has her own private security force believe all americans, not just the powerful, are entitled security. hillary clinton has had her chance. she failed. now time for new leadership. the hillary clinton agenda hurts poor people the most. there compassion allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons prey innocent people the first duty government keep the innocent safe, and when president will fight for the safety every american  and especially those americans who have not known safety for very, very long time asking for the vote every african-american citizen struggling our country today who wants different future time for our society address some honest and very difficult truths. the democratic party has failed and betrayed the african-american community. democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty. let look the situation right here milwaukee city run democrats for decade after decade. last year, killings this city increased percent, plus another 634 victims non-fatal shootings-year-olds accounted for nearly half the homicide victims. the poverty rate here nearly double the national average. almost african-american men milwaukee between the ages not have job. nearly four single mother households are living poverty public schools this city have been rated failing meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars funding per-pupil. there only% graduation rate, and one the worst public school systems the country manufacturing jobs has disappeared milwaukee since fully opened our markets china, and many african-american neighborhoods have borne the brunt this hit every voter milwaukee every voter living every inner city every forgotten stretch our society running offer you better future. the democratic party has taken the votes african-americans for granted. they just assumed they get your support and done nothing return for time give the democrats some competition for these votes, and time rebuild the inner cities america  and reject the failed leadership rigged political system not part the corrupt system fact, the corrupt system trying stop been paying own way. the voters the republican party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system. the other party  the democratic party  nominated the personification special interest corruption. the democratic party rigged the nomination give hillary clinton, thus giving the soul their party this year the special interests running listen your voice hear your cries for help. the quiet voices our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need have their demands heard. jobs. safety. opportunity. fair and equal representation reject the bigotry hillary clinton which panders and talks down communities color and sees them only votes, not individual human beings worthy better future. she doesn care all about the hurting people this country the suffering she has caused them. the african-american community has been taken for granted for decades the democratic party time break with the failures the past want offer americans new future time for rule the people, not rule special interests. every insider, getting rich off our broken system throwing money hillary clinton. the hedge fund managers, the wall street investors, the professional political class the powerful protecting the powerful. insiders fighting for insiders fighting for you. when talk about the insider, who are talking about the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests the lobbyists who know how insert that perfect loophole into every bill the financial industry that knows how regulate their competition out existence. the insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists washington, los angeles, and new york city, who are part the same failed status quo and want nothing change. every day you pick newspaper turn the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker some discredited washington insider says they oppose our campaign some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign wear their opposition badge honor. because means fighting for real change, not just partisan change fighting  all across the country are fighting  for peaceful regime change our own country. the media-donor-political complex that bled this country dry has replaced with new government and for the people. the leadership class washington which hillary clinton has been member for thirty years, has abandoned the people this country going give the people their voice back. think about. the people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer result. the people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led into one disastrous foreign war after another. the people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied about one trade deal after another. aren you tired system that gets rich your expense? aren you tired big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system keep your voice from being heard? are you ready for change? are you ready for leadership that puts you, the american people, first? that puts your country first? that puts your family first? let talk about what this means for the inner cities america time break through the television noise, the entrenched interests understand that lot powerful people our political system lot people who created our problems  will lose lot their contracts, and their special gigs african-american voters, and all minority voters, support campaign time stop making the special interests rich time make the american people rich going make america wealthy again. the democratic party has run nearly every inner city this country for years, and run them into financial ruin. they ruined the schools. they driven out the jobs. they tolerated level crime american should consider acceptable. violent crime has risen america largest cities last year. killings police officers this year nearly percent. homicides are more than baltimore. they are more than washington. this the future offered hillary clinton. more poverty, more crime, and more the same. the future she offers the most pessimistic thing can possibly imagine time for different future. here what proposing. first immigration community this country has been hurt worse hillary clinton immigration policies than the african-american community. now she proposing print instant work permits for millions illegal

know not politician have worked business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods entire adult life never wanted learn the language the insiders, and never been politically correct takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult. sometimes the heat debate and speaking multitude issues, you don choose the right words you say the wrong thing have done that, and regret, particularly where may have caused personal pain. too much stake for consumed with these issues. but one thing can promise you this will always tell you the truth speak the truth for all you, and for everyone this country who doesn have voice speak the truth behalf the factory worker who lost his her job speak the truth behalf the veteran who has been denied the medical care they need  and many are not making.

working, you replace product doesn deliver, you make change have patience for injustice tolerance for government incompetence sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. that why running end the decades bitter failure and offer the american people new future honesty, justice and opportunity future where america, and its people, always  and mean always  come first. aren you tired system that gets rich your expense? aren you tired the same old lies and the same old broken promises? and hillary clinton has proven one the greatest liars all time. aren you tired arrogant leaders who look down you, instead serving and protecting you? that all about change  and about change soon are going put the american people first again travelled all across this country laying out bold and modern agenda for change this journey will never lie you will never tell you something not believe will never put anyone interests ahead yours. and will never, ever stop fighting for you have special interest spending millions dollars own campaign  nobody else only interest the american people while sometimes can too honest, hillary clinton the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. one lie after another, and getting worse each passing day. the american people are still waiting for hillary clinton apologize for all the many lies she told them, and the many times she betrayed them. tell, has hillary clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting,000 emails? has hillary clinton apologized for turning the state department into pay-for-play operation where favors are sold the highest bidder? has she apologized for lying the families who lost loved ones benghazi? has she apologized for putting iran the path nuclear weapons? has she apologized for iraq? for libya? for syria? has she apologized for unleashing isis across the world? has hillary clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led much death, destruction and terrorism? speaking lies now know from the state department announcement that president obama lied about the $400 million dollars cash that was flown iran denied was for the hostages, but was said don pay ransom, but did lied about the hostages  openly and blatantly  just like lied about obamacare. now the administration has put every american travelling overseas, including our military personnel greater risk being kidnapped. hillary clinton owns president obama iran policy, one more reason she can never allowed president. let talk about the economy. here this beautiful state many people have suffered because nafta. bill clinton signed the deal, and hillary clinton supported. north carolina has lost nearly half its manufacturing jobs since nafta went into effect. bill clinton also put china into the world trade organization  another hillary clinton-backed deal. your city charlotte has lost manufacturing jobs since china joined the wto, and many these jobs were lost while hillary clinton was secretary state  our chief diplomat with china. she was disaster, totally unfit for the job. hillary clinton owes the state north carolina very big apology, and think you get that apology around the same time you get see her,000 deleted emails. another major issue this campaign has been the border. our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs pour into our communities much needless suffering much preventable death spent time with the families wonderful americans whose loved ones were killed the open borders and sanctuary cities that hillary clinton supports embraced the crying parents who lost their children violence spilling across our border. parents like laura wilkerson and michelle root and sabine durden and jamiel shaw whose children were killed illegal immigrants opponent supports sanctuary cities. but where was the sanctuary for kate steinle? where was the sanctuary for the children laura, michelle, sabine and jamiel? where was the sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered horribly? these moms and dads don get lot consideration from our politicians. they certainly don get apologies. they never even get the time day from hillary clinton. but they will always come first. listen closely will deliver justice for all these american families will create system immigration that makes all proud. hillary clinton mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families this country. please remember this will never put personal profit before national security will never leave our border open appease donors and special interests will never support trade deal that kills american jobs will never put the special interests before the national interest will never put donor before voter lobbyist before citizen. instead will champion for the people. the establishment media doesn cover what really matters this country what really going people lives. they will take words mine out context and spend week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend discover some hidden meaning what said. just imagine for second the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent americans like kate steinle killed  she was gunned down illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. just imagine the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness our inner cities. just think about how much different things would the media this country sent their cameras our border our closing factories our failing schools the media focused what dark secrets must hidden the,000 emails hillary clinton deleted. instead, every story told from the perspective the insiders the narrative the people who rigged the system, never the voice the people been rigged against many people suffering silence cameras coverage outrage from media class that seems get outraged over just about everything else again not about never been about about all the people this country who don have voice running their voice running the voice for every forgotten part this country that has been waiting and hoping for better future glad that make the powerful little uncomfortable now and again  including some powerful people own party. because means fighting for real change. there reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the wall street investors, are throwing their money hillary clinton. because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged their favor the powerful protecting the powerful. the insiders fighting for the insiders fighting for you. here the change propose terrorism are going end the era nation-building and instead focus destroying isis and radical islamic terrorism will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner the world, and the middle east, that shares our goal defeating terrorism have message for the terrorists trying kill our citizens will find you will destroy you, and will win immigration will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot performed. all applicants for immigration will vetted for ties radical ideology, and will screen out anyone who doesn share our values and love our people. anyone who believes sharia law supplants american law will not given immigrant visa you want join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way life. those who believe oppressing women, gays, hispanics, african-americans and people different faiths are not welcome join our country will promote our america values, our american way life, and our american system government which are all the best the world opponent the other hand wants 550% increase syrian refugees. her plan would bring roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations her first term top all other immigration. hillary clinton running america angela merkel, and seen how much crime and how many problems that caused the german people have enough problems already don need another one crime are going add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors the world will pursue strong enforcement federal laws. the gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will stripped apart one one. their day over trade are going renegotiate nafta, withdraw from the tpp, stand china our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last american job. hillary clinton has supported all the major trade deals that have stripped this country its jobs and its wealth taxes are going massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses  creating millions new good paying jobs are going get rid regulations that send jobs overseas and are going make easier for young americans get the credit they need start small business and pursue their dreams education are going give students choice, and allow charter schools thrive are going end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones opponent wants deny students choice and opportunity, all get little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. she doesn care how many young dreams are dashed the process are going work closely with african-american parents and students the inner cities  and what big difference that will make. this means lot, and going top priority trump administration healthcare are going repeal and replace obamacare. countless americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about jump double-digits yet again, and just this week aetna announced pulling out the exchanges north carolina are going replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control healthcare much lower cost political corruption are going restore honor our government administration going enforce all laws concerning the protection classified information one will above the law going forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve going ask senior officials sign agreement not accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office from any entity tied foreign government. finally are going bring this country together are going emphasizing what all have common americans are going reject the bigotry hillary clinton, which sees communities color only votes and not human beings worthy better future african-american voters give donald trump chance giving their vote, the result for them will amazing. look how badly things are going under decades democratic leadership  look the schools, look the young african-americans not working time for change. what you have lose trying something new will fix. this means much, and will work hard can bring new opportunity places our country which have not known opportunity very long time. hillary clinton and the democratic party have taken african-american votes totally for granted. because the votes have been automatically there, there has been reason for democrats produce time break with the failures the past, and fight for every last american child this country have the better future they deserve administration, every american will treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression all its forms, and seek new future built

millions workers the sidelines will returned the work force. and not elected president, that will never happen, believe. they talking you, they playing you, but believe, you know the answer. and have say that been talking about michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out your land, and have been doing for four years the people michigan. other people started talking about last week. they not going anything about. crumbling roads, bridges and airports will replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.  families strapped welfare

know safety and peace again.  american values and cultures will cherished - and mean cherished and celebrated once again. but achieve this new american future must break free from the bitter failures the past, and reject the same insiders telling the same old lies over and over, and over again group america has been more harmed hillary clinton policies than african-americans group group hillary clinton goal was inflict pain the african-american community, she could not have done better job disgrace.  tonight asking for the vote every single african-american citizen this country who wants see better future.  the inner cities our country have been run the democratic party for more than years. their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes time hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done these communities what point say enough what point say enough time hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again. look what the democratic party has done the city example and there are many others detroit percent detroit residents percent, live poverty. half all detroit residents not work, and cannot work, and can get job detroit tops the list most dangerous cities terms violent crime, number one. this the legacy the democratic politicians who have run this city. this the result the policy agenda embraced crooked hillary clinton. booing,000-mails gone. booing the only way change results change leadership can never fix our problems relying the same politicians who created our problems the first place new future requires brand new leadership.  look how much african-american communities are suffering from democratic control those say the following, what you have lose trying something new like trump? what you have lose say again, what you have lose? look, you living poverty. your schools are good. you have jobs your youth unemployed. what the hell you have lose? and the end four years guarantee you that will get over the african american vote promise you. because will produce will produce for the inner cities and will produce for the african americans. and the democrats will not produce and all they have done taken advantage your vote. that all they done. and once the election over, they back their palaces washington. and you know what? they nothing for you. just remember, you have nothing lose. one thing know for sure you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results administration will work for you one has ever done before will work will bring back jobs will work contrast, the one thing every item hillary clinton agenda has common that takes jobs and opportunities away from african american workers takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving michigan. your companies are leaving every single state our union. they going mexico. they going everywhere but here. hillary clinton supports open borders. which means many things but means people pouring and they take your jobs. whether you like don like. they take your jobs. her fierce opposition school choice. you need choice. you have get your children into good schools. you that through competition. you need choice. her plan massively raise taxes small business and everyone trillion tax increase. where cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class. her tremendous opposition american energy. her opposition fierce and her record giving our jobs away many many other countries. america must reject the bigot dream hillary clinton who sees communities color only votes, not human beings worthy better future. hillary clinton would rather provide job refugee from overseas that give that job unemployed african american youth cities like detroit, who have become refugees their own country time get our country back work and that includes all out effort help young african americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve. hillary clinton plan would bring estimated 620,000 refugees her first term lifetime benefit cost some $400 billion our country. according the senate immigration subcommittee. hillary clinton wants america angela merkel the way, for the price supporting one refugee the united states could support safe zone the middle east let say syria. the approved refugee screening standards that have proposed will save countless, billions dollars called extreme vetting. extreme vetting will invest portion the money saved the jobs program for inner city youth. the african american community has given much this country. they fought and died every war since the revolution. they lifted the conscience our nation the long march towards civil rights. they sacrificed much for the national good. yet, nearly african americans children still live poverty and said african americans are not working. they cannot find job must better country refuse believe that the future must like the past won. our future will great future for everyone. for everyone trump administration, all workers all colors will get priorities for jobs their own country which about time want higher wages for african americans, for hispanic americans, and for all americans want higher wages  many, many workers our country are making substantially less money today real wages than they made years ago. they working two jobs instead one. they working much harder they get older and supposed the opposite gonna stop going create great jobs and gonna get the wages. hillary clinton throwback ugly past where politicians preyed our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain. promises, promises, all talk action. all talk action politicians. they talk, talk, talk. you vote them with great fan fare and then they just nothing. with trump, that not going happen. believe must turn the page yesterday, only change leadership will produce change outcomes. and can take country, four more years obama. and that what you get with hillary clinton but probably worse this new american future, american workers will always come first. america first, always come first. this will include complete revitalization the michigan manufacturing sector. now, you have understand, the michigan manufacturing sector disaster disaster. look your notes, look your stats, look what happening your state. you losing your businesses like taking candy away from baby. and many people right now this audience that think you have jobs, you gonna find out very soon that your company leaving from mexico some other place and you not going have your job for very long. and trump gets, those days are over folks, they over will brining back our jobs michigan. there will very big price pay for those companies that wanna leave our land someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with retribution won happen. there will consequence. won happen will not happen. michigan lost more than its manufacturing jobs since nafta you know, nafta, one the worst trade bills history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed the history the world. not only our country. its emptied out michigan, its emptied out new england. its emptied out new york state. its emptied out many our great companies. they leave and they fire end with devastation end with unemployment end with nothing. the bill was signed bill clinton. booing was supported hillary clinton. booing right here this community, you have lost manufacturing jobs since bill clinton put china into the world trade organization. another hillary clinton back deal. she backs all the deals. and the way, she will backing trans pacific partnership. tpp she elected. just mark your words. just remember, you know gonna happen. she considered the gold standard. all sudden when she heard talking about, she said can win this one she went against. she will back immediately, and you saw that when the governor virginia, who her friend, said that was going happen. detroit lost more than manufacturing jobs following the nafta and wto agreements. that was supported very strongly opponent industry, has been hurt more hillary clinton policies than the automobile industry call the car industry has been total disaster. according the bureau the labor statistics, before nafta went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers michigan. today, that number down only 160,000 and going lot lower because you look the massive plants being built right now mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye. booing but not. not with won happen 2014, general motors announced plans double its investments mexico plans 2018. not good. booing april 2016, ford motor company announced plans invest another billion constructing auto plant mexico. mexico will become the car capital the world very, very quickly. and michigan going end with lots empty buildings all over the place unless you elect donald trump president which case not gonna happen same month, fiat chrysler announced,300 layoffs. the list goes and will turn around will turn around fast will meet with these companies and will say will not easy for you move your plant mexico for you sell your cars through what will very strong border, and for you not pay tax those cars coming, okay?  and when tell them that there will substantial tax the cars that they make mexico and other places, number one, they not going move the first place, and number two they, our country will make one heck lot money.  but save your jobs and all the things that talking about have win november 8th.  the destruction that nafta started will finished off the transpacific partnership approved will almost, nothing bad nafta, but will almost bad nafta know from hillary closest friend, that she planning ram through tpp she elected. she even called said, the gold standard. its passage would disaster for michigan particular, for the car industry particular, for the people michigan won let happen.  according the economic policy institute, the united states trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs our country 2015 far the biggest losses occurred motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think that 740,000 manufacturing jobs. michigan ranks first for jobs lost share state workforce due trade deficit with tpp members. just imagine how many more automobile jobs will lost hillary gets her wish and approves tpp will not pretty. that why have announced that will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen have have previously laid out detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available website includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like china and tariffs against any nation that cheats unfairly subsidizing their goods which many them plan also includes total renegotiation nafta our jobs can come back.  and can make much, much better deal than have right now will walk not any way, shape form isolationist don believe, but have make great deals for our country losing our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion year. that our trade deficit. who negotiates these deals want great trade deals and will have them.  but want trade deals that work for america, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the american worker want shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit don want expand, and been expanding for years. for years and years. you look the charts. and say myself often, why don they something about? and the reason have political hacks our negotiators have politicians our negotiators have politicians that are controlled like hillary clinton her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won let her what right for our workers and for our country want leading the world production, exports and manufacturing want jobs leave from other countries and come into our country for change.  another major issue this race foreign policy. hillary clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another. beginning with the support for going war iraq, and opposed strongly. nobody cared was civilian, but opposed said you will have total destabilization the middle east was such common sense and look what happened. her tenure secretary state may regarded the most disastrous united states history. but she totally without remorse. her failed decisions secretary state unleashed isis onto the world. booing but has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused. look the world before and after she became secretary state. pre-hillary the early 2009s, iraq was seeing reduction violence. libya was somewhat stable. syria was under control. the

country. more than,700 have been shot chicago alone this year american should consider this level crime acceptable. every american has the right live safety and peace trump administration going restore law and order. let take this opportunity thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. this state has known unbelievable heartache recent days after the murder police officers, and the wounding another the assault dallas pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery the wounded all law enforcement america are with you support you, and will always stand with you. together will create safe community for every citizen the land  but especially those who have not known safety very, very long time. that includes appointing attorney general and secretary homeland security who are completely committed upholding the law will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-hand with police and citizens dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will appoint prosecutors who will into the most dangerous communities america and work liberate our citizens from violence and fear. all citizens deserve protected american left behind want every african-american parent this country  and all parents this country able raise their kids safety. and want ensure every african-american child this country  and all children this country  are put the american ladder success good education, and good-paying job are going have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers opponent, hillary clinton, discriminates against african-american students opposing school choice because she owned and paid for the education bureaucracy one owns answer only the american people new york post column, deroy murdock, published data confirming what been saying about the devastating economic conditions the african-american communities. murdock confirms these facts: ""the overall labor force participation rate for black americans has slipped from percent percent  down percent. this metric also slumped for black teenagers, from percent percent  down percent. the percentage black americans poverty has grown under obama, the census bureau reports, from percent 2009 percent 2014 percent. the number blacks food stamps soared under obama  from million 2009 million 2014 percent. also, from obama arrival through last june, the percentage black americans who own homes plunged from percent, the census reports  down percent."" nearly african american children live poverty percent young african americans are not employed. homicide nearly percent washington. and more than percent baltimore. violent crime rose percent the fifty largest cities. this the legacy president obama and hillary clinton those suffering say: what you have lose trying something new? let also tell you what you have gain: more jobs, higher wages, and massive reduction the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities are going turn all around. success must created for everyone, and available everyone. that how are going create new american future. but make every american safe and prosperous must address one the most vital issues all: border security are going build wall are going enforce the law are going protect your jobs and wages. and are going keep our country safe. according the texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into texas jails between 2011 and 2016. collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half million criminal offenses, including,055 homicides,516 sexual assault charges and more than,000 charges either burglary theft. yet, hillary clinton wants totally, completely open border. she wants catch-and-release. obamacare for illegal immigrants. massive amnesty her first 100 days. she wants gut immigration enforcement. she supports sanctuary cities. she wants let people overstay their visas without removal. one lawless order after another must not let happen. hillary clinton also wants 550% increase syrian refugees. there have been hundreds immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the united states since, and number terrible attacks like the boston bombing, san bernardino and orlando. yet hillary clinton wants fling open the floodgates even wider want create safe zones the middle east plan suspends visas when can perform effective screening, and puts forward new ideological screening program keep out people from our country who don support our values. after all, that what taking the oath citizenship all about. this election will decide whether not have border. this election will decide whether not have country. today met with the moms american children killed illegal immigrants result the policies hillary clinton supports. hillary clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories. these are all forgotten americans  they are not hollywood media stars big money special interest donors. she bought-and-paid-for the special interests. this corruption relates closely another corruption scandal that strikes the heart our democracy. every day more and more alarming facts come out. the scandal speak the state department pay-for-play scandal under hillary clinton our secretary state can bought bribed sell trade government favors, then the whole american system threatened threat the foundation democracy itself. this what happens third world country the failed conditions people flee when they come america. america can never elect candidate who, like hillary clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts cash. the new revelations about hillary clinton email scandal make clear have only seen the tip the iceberg. hillary clinton desperate cover her crimes. that why she deleted,000 emails. that also why she lied repeatedly congress and the american public. she said she never sent received classified materials. that was lie, proved over and over again. she claimed she used insecure email server for the convenience using only one device. but she used multiple devices. another lie. under penalty perjury, she said she turned over all her work-related emails. but the fbi found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another,000 more. another clinton lie. she said she sent nothing marked classified total lie, unmasked the world. and more come. she said her server was secure, and had breaches. but know now was completely unsecure, and the fbi director said could easily hacked our foreign enemies. more clinton lies. clinton said her lawyers reviewed all her emails before destroying them. one more hillary clinton lie. lie after lie after lie. hillary clinton unfit hold public office impossible figure out where the clinton foundation ends and the state department begins now abundantly clear that the clintons' set business profit from public office. they sold access and specific actions and them for money goes back the arkansas days, and continued during the white house days with the sale the lincoln bedroom large donors. but once bill was out office the small time clinton business, more accurately, their crime enterprise  grew with the roles reversed. bill, now-president collected the money for the clinton foundation and hillary clinton had the public offices sell; senator, secretary state and for all that time potential president. they turned this into exponentially larger business. but was more than business was continuing big time criminal enterprise involved numerous violations the conflict interest and bribery laws and other serious laws the united states. the-mails and phone logs show that the clinton foundation and the clinton department state were one and the same you donated the clinton foundation paid massive speaking fees bill clinton, you got entry the department state. together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale public office since the teapot dome scandal the 1920s. today phone log was released for cheryl mills. she was secretary state clinton chief staff. you would expect the log contain only calls concerning department state business. but cheryl mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the chief operating officer the clinton foundation other individual group appears have left that many messages also just learned today that more than half the people who met with hillary clinton from outside government while she was secretary state were donors the foundation. this creates the nexus which the core rico case other words, they merged the two into the clinton family racketeering enterprise. the specific crimes committed carry out that enterprise are too numerous cover this speech walked through two them yesterday  the sale. uranium russia, and the exemption telecom giant from sanctions after they paid bill clinton for speech. the ubs saga another one. shortly after hillary clinton became secretary state she went geneva and intervened dispute concerning secret identities americans. she negotiated very good deal for ubs and very bad deal for law enforcement the,000 accounts the. was seeking, the government settled for only,450 accounts. her intervention was described treasury unusual. before her unusual intervention ubs had donated only,000 the foundation. after the clinton favor for ubs opened its wallet for big bucks and out came $600,000 contribution million loan and million speaking fee for bill clinton. this corruption, pure and simple. this why have called for special prosecutor. justice supposed blind never supposed for sale the long-run, there only one way end the corruption our country: elect donald. trump. hillary clinton thinks she above the law. come november, the american people will show her that she not. you will voting for justice, fairness and equality. you will also voting for more inclusive country, where one left out. another million latinos have joined the ranks those poverty. incomes for latino households have declined nearly,000 under president obama. the number latino children living poverty increased percent. our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda going bring hope back every community our nation will dedicate myself restore the ladder success all those who live poverty reject the bigotry hillary clinton, who sees communities color only votes, not human beings worthy better future. the era division coming end will create new future american unity. are you ready for real american change time emphasize what all have common americans will promote our common culture, values and principles will one nation will one people will share together one great future going america first. together will make america proud again will make america prosperous again will make america safe again. friends, citizens and fellow americans will make america great

 should celebrated and cherished. this includes the amazing achievements art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and much else. this includes millions african-american entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions african-american workers our middle class. but must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering disastrous conditions many our inner cities  and neighborhoods afflicted poverty, drugs, and violence group america has been more harmed hillary clinton policies than african-americans. there better evidence this fact than hillary clinton immigration policy, which brings illegal immigrants and refugees take jobs from hardworking african-american and hispanic citizens. instead providing free healthcare and jobs millions refugees from around the world should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs struggling americans. tonight asking for the vote every african-american and hispanic citizen this country who wants better future. the inner cities our country have been run the democratic party for fifty, sixty, seventy years. these democratic policies  the policies hillary clinton  have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime. nearly african-american children live poverty, including children under the age six african-american youth are not working. meanwhile, another million hispanic-americans have been added the ranks those poverty since 2009 detroit, half all its residents not work milwaukee, almost african-american men between the ages not have job. here the state washington latino children and african-american children live low-income households. chicago just had the most violent month years. more than,800 have been shot chicago since the beginning the year breaks our hearts cannot let this violence continue must ended. under trump administration will ended will priority work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement dismantle the gangs and liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission. there one thing which can longer denied you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results those suffering say: what you have lose voting for donald trump will fix will fight for you one ever has before. let also tell you what you have gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety. this means much believe every child this country detroit baltimore chicago  has the right live out their lives safety and peace the wall street journal, heather mac donald the manhattan institute just wrote important article about the soaring crime our inner cities, and the responsibility democratic politicians for creating this problem. the article called: ""black lives matter donald trump."" mcdonald writes that. trump call restore law and order recognizes the right inner-city residents enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest america now takes for granted."" freedom from violence one the great civil rights issues our time too the issue school choice will fight for the right parents send their kids the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot success will not accept future which children any color this country are not fully included the american dream. our whole country loses when leave millions talented, aspiring americans the sidelines want give everyone chance contribute their full talents our economy and our country. remember: the republican party the party lincoln, the party freedom, equality and opportunity the democratic party that the party slavery, the party jim crow, the party oppression. nothing makes more honored and proud than the nominee abraham lincoln republican party. our party will fight bring hope every forgotten stretch this country. once again will one american nation. one united people. and will have one great future. that great future will built these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs. this will include complete revitalization our manufacturing sector, which has been badly hurt hillary clinton policies are bringing the jobs back our country are going renegotiate nafta, keep out the trans-pacific partnership, stand china, and fight for every last american job. the destruction that nafta started will finished off the trans-pacific partnership approved. that would disaster won let happen. but that just the beginning what are going for american workers taxes are going provide massive tax relief all working people, and lower the tax rate small business from% down%. low and middle-income parents will also able fully deduct the average cost childcare from their taxes regulations going direct every agency and department head government identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will removed will have temporary moratorium new regulations allow our economy grow and thrive. economic growth for last quarter has been revised down total disaster. meanwhile, our trade deficit goods with the world now nearly $800 billion dollars will further bring back our jobs unleashing american energy revolution  lifting restrictions oil, coal, natural gas and all sources american energy. this will create millions jobs and lower the price energy for all families are also going secure our border stop the drugs from pouring. the seattle-area recently experienced the largest number heroin-related deaths years have stop the drugs poisoning our communities. another major issue this race foreign policy. hillary clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another  beginning with her support for going war iraq the first place, which opposed. her tenure secretary state may regarded the most disastrous. history. look the world before and after she became secretary state. pre-hillary early 2009, iraq was seeing reduction violence. libya was stable. syria was under control. the group know today isis was close being extinguished. iran was being choked sanctions. now, fast-forward present time. after hillary, here what the world looks like: iraq total chaos. syria the midst disastrous civil war and refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states. isis has been unleashed onto the entire world. iran  the world top state sponsor terrorism  has been put the path nuclear weapons, and was given $400 million dollar cash ransom payment. this the legacy hillary clinton: death, destruction and terrorism. america deserves better legacy. all you deserve better future the change agent. hillary clinton the defender the status quo. while our country lost badly under hillary clinton, she cashed big time. bill clinton speaking fees surged while hillary was secretary state  bill was paid almost million dollars for speeches during her tenure increase% over the previous years. then there was all the money funneled into the clinton foundation from foreign governments and corporations was pay-for-play. just look what she did with ubs the russian uranium disaster relief haiti, and many other examples. but the only way learn the full depth her public corruption read the,000 emails she deleted. hillary clinton said under oath that she turned over all her work-related emails. but know that one more clinton lie. the fbi found thousands work-related emails she never turned over, and then another,000 emails were just discovered few weeks ago. now, today, another emails were discovered the state department that hillary clinton failed turn over  these were emails about benghazi just never ends with the clintons. there only one way get justice this rigged system and that show and vote november 8th  and vote big

"wow. thank you. that lot people, phoenix, that lot people. thank you very much. thank you, phoenix glad back arizona. the state that has very, very special place heart love people arizona and together are going win the white house november. now, you know this where all began for. remember that massive crowd also said let and have some fun tonight going arizona? this will little bit different. this won rally speech, per. instead going deliver detailed policy address one the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration just landed having returned from very important and special meeting with the president mexico man like and respect very much. and man who truly loves his country, mexico. and the way, just like man who loves country, the united states agree the importance ending the illegal flow drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and put the cartels out business also discussed the great contributions mexican-american citizens our two countries love for the people mexico, and the leadership and friendship between mexico and the united states was thoughtful and substantive conversation and will for awhile. and the end all going win. both countries all going win. this the first what expect will many, many conversations. and trump administration going about creating new relationship between our two countries, but going fair relationship want fairness. but fix our immigration system must change our leadership washington and must change quickly. sadly, sadly there other way. the truth our immigration system worse than anybody ever realized. but the facts aren known because the media won report them. the politicians won talk about them and the special interests spend lot money trying cover them because they are making absolute fortune. that the way. today very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. the fundamental problem with the immigration system our country that serves the needs wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians all you can. thank you. thank you. let tell you who does not serve does not serve you the american people. doesn serve you. when politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. immigration reform should mean something else entirely should mean improvements our laws and policies make life better for american citizens. thank you. but going make our immigration system work, then have prepared talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. for instance have listen the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace immigration and impact their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions. these are valid concerns expressed decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over also have honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks join our country will able successfully assimilate. sometimes just not going work out our right sovereign nation chose immigrants that think are the likeliest thrive and flourish and love. then there the issue security. countless innocent american lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed their duty secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have enforced have met with many the great parents who lost their children sanctuary cities and open borders many people many, many people sad. they will joining this stage little while and look forward introducing, these are amazing, amazing people. countless americans who have died recent years would alive today not for the open border policies this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called hillary clinton. this includes incredible americans like year old sarah root. the man who killed her arrived the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the., think, into the. community under the policies the white house barack obama and hillary clinton. weak, weak policies. weak and foolish policies was released again after the crime, and now out there large. sarah had graduated from college with, top student her class one day before her death. also among the victims the obama-clinton open borders policy was grant ronnebeck-year-old convenience store clerk and really good guy from mesa, arizona lot you have known about grant was murdered illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew was going happen again. another victim kate steinle. gunned down the sanctuary city san francisco illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. and they knew was good. then there the case-year-old earl olander, who was brutally beaten and left bleed death his home years old and defenseless. the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records mile long, who did not meet obama administration standards for removal. and they knew was going happen california-year-old air force veteran great woman, according everybody that knew her, marilyn pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten death with hammer. her killer had been arrested multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out 2011 report from the government accountability office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens our prisons and jails together, had around,000 homicide arrests their names,000 top that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars year. and this what get. for the money are going spend illegal immigration over the next years could provide million-risk students with school voucher, which many people are wanting. while there are many illegal immigrants our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable american workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back. and they hurting lot our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances. but these facts are never reported. instead, the media and opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs people living here illegally many cases the way, they treated better than our vets. not going happen anymore, folks. november 8th. not going happen anymore. the truth, the central issue not the needs the million illegal immigrants however many there may -- and honestly been hearing that number for years always million. our government has idea could million could million. they have idea what the number. frankly our government has idea what they doing many, many fronts, folks. but whatever the number, that never really been the central issue will never central issue doesn matter from that standpoint. anyone who tells you that the core issue the needs those living here illegally has simply spent too much time washington. only the out touch media elites think the biggest problems facing america -- you know this, this what they talk about, facing american society today that there are million illegal immigrants who don have legal status. and, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this not nuclear, and not isis not russia not china global warming all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from and all you today. there only one core issue the immigration debate, and that issue the well being the american people. nothing even comes close second. hillary clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will separated, but she not talking about the american families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because preventable homicide, because preventable death, because murder, she only talking about families who come here violation the law will treat everyone living residing our country with great dignity important will fair, just, and compassionate all, but our greatest compassion must for our american citizens. thank you. president obama and hillary clinton have engaged gross dereliction duty surrendering the safety the american people open borders, and you know better than anybody right here arizona. you know. president obama and hillary clinton support sanctuary cities. they support catch and release the border. they support visa overstays. they support the release dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. and, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty. hillary clinton has pledged amnesty her first 100 days, and her plan will provide obamacare, social security, and medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget top that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues reduce jobs and wages for american workers, and especially for african-american and hispanic workers within our country. our citizens. most incredibly, because this unbelievable have idea who these people are, where they come from always say trojan horse. watch what going happen, folks not going pretty. this includes her plan bring 620,000 new refugees from syria and that region over short period time. and even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands people coming from syria. what wrong with our politicians, our leaders can call them that. what the hell are doing? hard believe. hard believe. now that you heard about hillary clinton plan, about which she has not answered single question, let tell you about plan.and you notice -- and you notice all the time for weeks and weeks debating plan, debating, talking about, what about this, what about that. they never even mentioned her plan immigration because she doesn want get into the quagmire tough one, she doesn know what she doing except open borders and let everybody come and destroy our country the way. while hillary clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration offices, very great people. among the top immigration experts anywhere this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important also worked with lawmakers, who led this issue behalf american citizens for many years. and most importantly met with the people directly impacted these policies important. number one, are you ready? are you ready will build great wall along the southern border. and mexico will pay for the wall. one hundred percent. they don know yet, but they going pay for. and they great people and great leaders but they going pay for the wall day one will begin working intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that the tunnels. remember that, above and below. above and below ground sensors. towers, aerial surveillance and manpower supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and mexico you know that, will work with really believe. mexico will work with absolutely believe. and especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today really believe they want solve this problem along with, and sure they will. number two are going end catch and release catch them ahead catch them ahead. under administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will detained until they are removed out our country and back the country from which they came. and they brought great distances not dropping them right across. they learned that. president eisenhower. they drop them across, right across, and they come back. and across. then when they flew them long distance, all sudden that was the end will take them great distances. but will take them the country where they came from? number three. number three, this the one think great hard believe, people don even talk about. zero tolerance for criminal aliens. zero. zero. zero. they don come here. they don come here. according federal data, there are least million million, think, criminal aliens now inside our country million people criminal aliens will begin moving them out day one soon take office. day one joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement. now, just you understand, the police, who all respect -- say hello the police. boy, they don get the credit they deserve can tell you. they great people. but the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. they live with these people. they get mocked these people. they can anything about these people, and they want. they know who these people are. day one first hour office, those people are gone. and you can call deported you want. the press doesn like that term. you can call whatever the hell you want. they gone. beyond the million, and there are vast numbers additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out this country. the crime will stop. they going gone will over. they going out. they going out fast. moving forward will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will placed into immediate removal proceedings even have that will terminate the obama administration deadly, and deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands criminal aliens freely roam our streets, walk around whatever they want, crime all over the place. that over. that over, folks. that over. since 2013 alone, the obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens return back into united states communities. these are individuals encountered identified ice, but who were not detained processed for deportation because wouldn have been politically correct plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions remove criminal aliens immediately will restore the highly successful secure communities program. good program will expand and revitalize the popular 287 partnerships, which will help identify hundreds thousands deportable aliens local jails that don even know about. both these programs have been recklessly gutted this administration. and those were programs that worked. this yet one more area where are headed totally opposite direction. there common sense, there brain power our administration our leader our leaders. none, none, none. here interesting graphic from study published this summer voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric immigration -- tough enforcement amnesty, deportations -- and its affect their own opinions first day office also going ask congress pass kate law, named for kate steinle ensure that criminal aliens convicted illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. strong. and then get them out. another reform proposing the passage legislation named for detective michael davis and deputy sheriff danny oliver law enforcement officers recently killed previously deported illegal immigrant. the davis-oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. and they will face, believe. they going going triple the number ice deportation officers. within ice going create new special deportation task force focused identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants america who have evaded justice just like hillary clinton has evaded justice? maybe they able deport her. the local police who know every one these criminals, and they know each and every one name crime, where they live, they will work fast. and our local police will happy that they don have abused these thugs anymore. there great mystery, they put with for years, and finally will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will allowed clear this dangerous and threatening mess also going hire,000 more border patrol agents. who gave their endorsement,500 gave their endorsement. and put more them the border instead behind desks which good will expand the number border patrol stations significantly had chance spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and want take moment thank them. what they incredible. and getting their endorsement means much. more really than can say. means much. first time they ever endorsed presidential candidate. number four, block funding for sanctuary cities block the funding more funds will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted many needless deaths. cities that refuse cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and will work with congress pass legislation protect those jurisdictions that assist federal authorities. number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws will immediately terminate president obama two illegal executive amnesties which defied federal law and the constitution give amnesty approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million. and how about all the millions that are waiting line, going through the process legally unfair. hillary clinton has pledged keep both these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked the united states supreme court. great. clinton has also pledged add third executive amnesty. and the way, folks, she will disaster for our country disaster many other ways. and don forget the supreme court the united states. don forget that when you vote november. and don forget your second amendment. and don forget the repeal and replacement obamacare. and don forget building our depleted military. and don forget taking care our vets. don forget our vets. they have been forgotten. clinton plan would trigger constitutional crisis unlike almost anything have ever seen before effect, she would abolishing the lawmaking powers congress order write her own laws from the oval office. and you see what bad judgment she has. she has seriously bad judgment. can you imagine trump administration all immigration laws will enforced, will enforced with any law enforcement activity will set priorities. but unlike this administration one will immune exempt from enforcement. and ice and border patrol officers will allowed their jobs the way their jobs are supposed done. anyone who has entered the united states illegally subject deportation. that what means have laws and have country. otherwise don have country. our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. that those relying public welfare straining the safety net along with millions recent illegal arrivals and overstays who come here under this current corrupt administration. number six are going suspend the issuance visas any place where adequate screening cannot occur. according data provided the senate subcommittee immigration, and the national interest between and the end 2014 least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted terror cases inside the united states. and even right now the largest number people are under investigation for exactly this that ever had the history our country. our country mess don even know what look for anymore, folks. our country has straighten out. and have straighten out fast. the number likely higher. but the administration refuses provide this information, even congress soon enter office going ask the department state, which has been brutalized hillary clinton, brutalized. homeland security and the department justice begin comprehensive review these cases order develop list regions and countries from which immigration must suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can put place call extreme vetting right? extreme vetting want extreme going tough, and somebody comes that fine but they going good extreme. and people don like got have country folks. got have country. countries which immigration will suspended would include places like syria and libya. and are going stop the tens thousands people coming from syria have idea who they are, where they come from. there documentation. there paperwork going end badly folks going end very, very badly. for the price resettling, one refugee the united states could resettled safe zone their home region. which agree with 100 percent have build safe zones and get the money from gulf states don want put the money owe almost trillion. doubled since obama took office, our national debt. but will get the money from gulf states and others supervise build safe zones which something that think all want see. another reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this important, especially you get the right people. and will get the right people ideological certification make sure that those are admitting our country share our values and love our people. thank you very proud our country. aren? really? with all going through very proud our country. for instance the last five years admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from iraq and afghanistan. and these two countries according pew research majority residents say that the barbaric practice honor killings against women are often sometimes justified. that what they say. that what they say. they justified. right? and admitting them our country. applicants will asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. attitudes radical islam, which our president refuses say and many other topics part this vetting procedure. and have the right people doing, believe, very, very few will slip through the cracks. hopefully, none. number seven will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported. there are least countries that refuse take their people back after they been ordered leave the united states. including large numbers violent criminals, they won take them back say keep them. not going happen with, not going happen with. due supreme court decision these violent offenders cannot sent home, our law enforcement officers have release them into your communities. and the way, the results are horrific, horrific. there are often terrible consequences, such casey chadwick tragic death connecticut just last year. yet despite the existence law that commands the secretary state stop issuing visas these countries. secretary hillary clinton ignored this law and refused use this powerful tool bring nations into compliance. and, they would comply would act properly other words had leaders that knew what they were doing, which don. the result her misconduct was the release thousands and thousands dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home their countries. instead have them all over the place. probably couple this room matter fact, but hope not. according report for the boston globe from the year 2008 2014 nearly,000 criminal aliens were released back into. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. hard believe with the power have. hard believe like the big bully that keeps getting beat. you ever see that? the big bully that keeps getting beat. these,000 release occurred hillary clinton watch. she had the power and the duty stop cold, and she decided she would not. and, arizona knows better than most exactly what talking about.  those released include individuals convicted killings, sexual assaults, and some the most heinous crimes imaginable. the boston globe writes that globe review 323 criminals released new england from 2008 2012 found that many percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation take them take them. number eight will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which need desperately. for years congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but has never been completed. the politicians are all talk action, never happens. never happens. hillary clinton, all talk. unfortunately when there action always the wrong decision. you ever notice administration will ensure that this system place. and will tell you will land will sea will air will have proper tracking system. approximately half new illegal immigrants came temporary visas and then never, ever left. why should the? nobody telling them leave. stay long you want take care you. beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are big problem, pose substantial threat national security. the commission said that this tracking system would high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials august and september 2001 conducting search for two the hijackers that were the united states expired visas. and, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. wouldn that have been wonderful, right? what that could have meant? last year alone nearly half million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. removing these overstays will top priority administration people around the world believe they can just come temporary visa and never, ever leave, the obama-clinton policy, that what, then have completely open border, and longer have country must send message that visa expiration dates will strongly enforced. number nine will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet will ensure that-verify used the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with congress strengthen and expand its use across the country. immigration law doesn exist for the purpose keeping criminals out exists protect all aspects american life. the work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else. that why immigration limits are established the first place only enforced the laws against crime, then have open border the entire world will enforce all our immigration laws. and the same goes for government benefits. the center for immigration studies estimates that percent households headed illegal immigrants use some form cash non-cash welfare programs like food stamps housing assistance. tremendous costs the way our country. tremendous costs. this directly violates the federal public charge law designed protect the united states treasury. those who abuse our welfare system will priorities for immediate removal. number will reform legal immigration serve the best interests america and its workers, the forgotten people. workers going take care our workers. and the way, and the way going make great trade deals going renegotiate trade deals going bring our jobs back home going bring our jobs back home have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably the history the world, and that starts with nafta. and now they want tpp, one the great disasters going bring our jobs back home. and companies want leave arizona and they want leave other states, there going lot trouble for them not going easy. there will consequence. remember that. there will consequence. they not going leaving another country, make the product, sell into the united states, and all end with taxes and total unemployment not going happen. there will consequences admitted million immigrants the united states between 1965 and 2015. many these arrivals have greatly enriched our country true. but now have obligation them and their children control future immigration are following you think, previous immigration waves had some big waves. and tremendously positive things have happened. incredible things have happened ensure assimilation want ensure that works. assimilation important word. integration and upward mobility. within just few

administration called america first. remember that choose immigrants based merit. merit, skill, and proficiency. doesn that sound nice? and establish new immigration controls boost wages and ensure that open jobs are offered american workers first. and that particular african- american and latino workers who are being shut out this process unfairly. and hillary clinton going nothing for the african- american worker, the latino worker. she going nothing. give your vote, she says november eighth. and then she say long, see you four years. that what. she going nothing. and just look the past. she done nothing. she been there for years. she done nothing. and say what you have lose? choose. watch how good going together. watch. you watch want people come into our country, but they have

people many many people sad they will joining this stage little while and look forward introducing these are amazing amazing people countless americans who have died recent years would alive today not for the open border policies this administration and the administration that causes this horrible horrible thought process called hillary clinton this includes incredible americans like year old sarah root the man who killed her arrived the border entered federal custody and then was released into the think into the community under the policies the white house barack obama and hillary clinton weak weak policies weak and foolish policies was released again after the crime and now out there large sarah had graduated from college with top student her class one day before her death also among the

fact that everybody wanted him out 011 report from the government accountability office found that illegal immigrants and other non citizens our prisons and jails together had around 000 homicide arrests their names 000 top that illegal immigration costs our country more than billion dollars year and this what get for the money are going spend illegal immigration over the next years could provide million risk students with school voucher which many people are wanting while there are many illegal immigrants our country who are good people many many this doesn change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable american workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back and they hurting lot our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances but these facts are never reported instead the media and opponent discuss one thing and only one thing the needs people living here illegally many cases the way they treated better than our vets not going happen anymore folks november not going happen anymore the truth the central issue not the needs the million illegal immigrants however many there may and honestly been hearing that number for years always million our government has idea could million could million they have idea what the number frankly our government has idea what they doing many many fronts folks but whatever the number that never really been the central issue will never central issue doesn matter from that standpoint anyone who tells you that the core issue the needs those living here illegally has simply spent too much time washington only the out touch media elites think the biggest problems facing america you know this this what they talk about facing american society today that there are million illegal immigrants who don have legal status and they also think the biggest thing and you know

problems that have gone unsolved for many years. for how long have people been saying washington broken and controlled special interests? this the year can finally fix. that because change has come from outside our broken and corrupt system will never fix our rigged system relying the people who rigged the first place will never solve our problems relying the politicians who created our problems every american who has been waiting for real change, your wait over  your moment liberation hand vote for trump vote restore democracy heal our economy, and bring millions jobs back into every forgotten stretch this country. the change will begin first day office. first are going eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule law our land. then are going begin implementing plans for construction wall along our southern border. this will keep out the violent cartels and gangs well their drugs that are poisoning our youth. but that just the beginning going ask congress send bill repeal and replace obamacare. under senate rules, that bill can passed with votes  meaning republican congress and republican president can save americans from this disaster single afternoon going very busy first day going instruct the department state immediately suspend the syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction safe zone the region opponent wants 550% increase syrian refugees. she running america angela merkel also going notify all countries that refuse take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes this country that they will lose access our visa programs they continue. this the measure that called for under current law, and will enforce. the secretary state required take this action, but hillary clinton refused  resulting thousands criminal aliens being released into. communities. furthermore will direct every agency government begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going removed  this will include lifting the restrictions american energy will also notify our nafta partners intention renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the tpp before can ratified are going bring these jobs back north carolina. hillary clinton supported nafta, she supported china entry into the world trade organization, and she supported the tpp. she just does whatever her donors tell her trump administration will negotiate trade deals behalf american workers  not behalf global corporations will work ensure farmers north carolina have the tools they need thrive home and compete level playing field foreign markets  and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put america first. crucially also going convene top generals and give them simple instruction: they will have days submit the oval office plan for defeating isis. any nation who shares this goal will our friend this mission. for years have been caught endless wars and conflicts under the leadership failed politicians and failed foreign policy establishment washington. the same people who made every wrong decision iraq, afghanistan, libya, syria, egypt, china and russia are the same people who are advising hillary clinton proud instead have the support our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how win  and know how keep out endless war. today retired. generals and admirals signed letter endorsement. that one the biggest differences between and hillary clinton. she favors what has been called military adventurism  rushing invade countries, displacing millions families, then inviting the refugees into our country  creating power vacuums filled terrorist groups like isis believe foreign policy based our national interests that focuses american security and regional stability  instead using our military create democracies countries with democratic history will work form partnerships overseas based long-term strategy defeating radical islamic terrorism will first have reverse the damage inflicted hillary clinton  her legacy failure the middle east, russia and asia has made americans less safe than ever before part our plan avoid and prevent foreign conflicts are going rebuild our depleted military. this the ultimate deterrent will guided those three famous words: peace through strength will ask congress eliminate the sequester and immediately-invest our military. right now have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one the smallest navy since 1917. like the cold war also need fight this battle collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. hillary clinton has taught all how much problem have with cyber-security can have someone the oval office who doesn understand the meaning the word confidential. the new revelations about hillary clinton from the just-released fbi documents make more clear than ever that she fails meet the minimum standard for running for public office she applied for low-level job the state department today she couldn even get security clearance. her conduct disqualifying. let run through what discovered those fbi documents important, and hoping matt lauer will ask about wednesday night the townhall clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton lied about her handling confidential information. she repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the fbi she didn understand that the letter"" meant confidential the documents she emailed separate occasions she said she couldn recall details about her mishandling classified information, and she couldn even name one step she took make sure foreign hackers couldn get into her server. keep mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program also clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered their actions. after her private server was revealed last march, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped clean using software designed prevent any recovery, called bleachbit. they used hammers destroy phones they couldn turned over later  and the way, who uses different phones years? the only people who use that many phones are usually involved very, very shady activity. people who have nothing hide don smash phones with hammers. people who have nothing hide don bleach their emails destroy evidence keep from being publicly archived required under federal law. hillary clinton failed turn over thousands documents, then tried shield her criminal conduct having her chief-staff declare herself hillary clinton private attorney. hillary and her top aides told the fbi and others related lawsuits that they couldn recall remember key facts hundreds different times  and that addition the guy who set the server pleading the 5th one takes all the risks hillary clinton took unless they are trying cover massive crimes. hillary clinton was using the state department dole out special favors and access her friends and donors called pay-for-play. one example pay-for-play what the clinton did haiti. let stop here for second and say how much love and appreciate the haitian-american community florida and across our country send our prayers the many still suffering haiti from the earthquake. but while haiti has suffered, the clintons and their pals have cashed. bill and hillary brothers have signed housing deals haiti, and one wound the board gold mining company. clinton foundation donors have seen the clintons pave the way for their investments one deal, hillary clinton set aside environmental and labor rules help south korean company with record violating workers' rights set what amounts sweat shop haiti. the facility has produced only fraction the jobs promised and faces reports wage theft. people are asking: where did all the money? this november the american people stop the clintons from raiding america the way they have raided many other people and places. one the groups america that have been harmed the most hillary clinton policies are african-americans. she sees them only votes, not people worthy better future. many african-americans have succeeded greatly this country will honor and protect their achievements. that includes lowering taxes for our small business owners fifteen percent. but millions african-americans our inner cities remain trapped poverty, joblessness and failing schools. the democratic party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more african-american children poverty, including those under the age six african-american youth are not working,900 people have been shot chicago since the beginning the year. nationwide, african-americans are nearly the murder victims under the age. this national crisis  and anybody who fails understand that not fit seek the presidency the united states those suffering crime and poverty say: give donald. trump chance. what you have lose embracing our platform change are going bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice will never, ever, ever take you for granted are going push new civil rights agenda believe every american has the right safe community great education and government that protects their jobs. this weekend had the honor join church service detroit the great faith ministries international with the amazing bishop wayne jackson was incredible and deeply moving experience will fight for detroit, for chicago, for baltimore, and for every neglected part this nation  and will fight bring all together one american people. let quote the same passage from the bible read saturday, from john one has ever seen god; but love one another, god lives and his love made complete."" imagine what our country could accomplish started working together one people, under one god, saluting one flag time break with the bitter failures the past, and embrace new american future this future will respect the dignity all americans  and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods will keep our children safe  which requires secure borders strong military, and supporting law enforcement. jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back our shores. government corruption will end  and the state department will answer the voters, not hillary clinton donors. republicans are the party abraham lincoln and, come november 8th will once again have government and for the people

"today here talk about three crucial words that should the center our foreign policy: peace through strength want achieve stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground proposing new foreign policy focused advancing america core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing easing tensions the world. this will require rethinking the failed policies the past can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold proud have the support warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how win  and how avoid the endless wars are caught now. just yesterday top generals and admirals endorsed campaign trump administration, our actions the middle east will tempered realism. the current strategy toppling regimes, with plan for what the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled terrorists. gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should our guiding objective that region should work with any country that shares our goal destroying isis and defeating radical islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based this mission now have administration, and former secretary state, who refuse say radical islamic terrorism. immediately after taking office will ask generals present plan within days defeat and destroy isis. this will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare laid out speech defeating radical islamic terrorism several weeks ago. instead apology tour will proudly promote our system government and our way life the best the world  just like did our campaign against communism during the cold war will show the whole world how proud are american the same time, immigration security vital part our national security only want admit people our country who will support our values and love our people. these are the pillars sound national security strategy. unlike opponent foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. hillary clinton legacy iraq, libya, and syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. her destructive policies have displaced millions people, then she has invited the refugees into the west with plan screen them. including veteran healthcare costs, the price the wars iraq and afghanistan could total trillion, according report the washington examiner. yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, clinton policies secretary state have left the middle east more disarray than ever before. meanwhile, china has grown more aggressive, and north korea more dangerous and belligerent. russia has defied this administration every turn. putin has respect for president obama hillary clinton. sometimes has seemed like there wasn country the middle east that hillary clinton didn want invade, intervene topple. she trigger-happy and unstable when comes war. hillary clinton just reckless reckless fact, she put her emails illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. then clinton team used technology called bleachbit acid wash her emails. they even took hammer some her phones cover her tracks and obstruct justice. these email records were destroyed after she received subpoena turn them over the fbi report, she claimed she couldn recall important information occasions. she can even remember whether she was trained classified information, and said she didn even know the letter"" means confidential she can remember such crucial events and information, she unfit commander-chief. her conduct simply disqualifying. she talks about her experience, but hillary clinton only foreign policy experience ""failure."" everywhere she got involved, things got worse. let look back the middle east the very beginning 2009, before hillary clinton was sworn. libya was stable. syria was under control. egypt was ruled secular president and ally the united states. iraq was experiencing reduction violence. the group that would become what now call isis was close being extinguished. iran was being choked off economic sanctions. fast-forward today. what have the decisions obama-clinton produced? libya ruins, our ambassador and three other brave americans are dead, and isis has gained new base operations. syria the midst disastrous civil war. isis controls large portions territory refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states. and hundreds thousands are dead egypt, terrorists have gained foothold the sinai desert, near the suez canal, one the most essential waterways the world. iraq chaos, and isis the loose. isis has spread across the middle east, and into the west. iran, the world largest state sponsor terrorism now flush with $150 billion dollars cash released the united states  plus another billion dollars cash ransom payments other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard amount money. worst all, the nuclear deal puts iran, the number one state sponsor radical islamic terrorism path nuclear weapons. this hillary clinton foreign policy legacy. but that not all. president obama and hillary clinton have also overseen deep cuts our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries. history shows that when america not prepared when the danger greatest want deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength. under barack obama and hillary clinton, defense spending track fall its lowest level share the economy since the end world war currently have the smallest army since 1940. the navy among the smallest has been since 1915. and the air force the smallest has been since 1947. when ronald reagan left office, our navy had 592 ships. when barack obama took office had 285 ships. today, the navy has just 276 ships. the average air force aircraft years-old have 2nd generation bombers  their fathers flew the same plane. our army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers 2009 just 479,000 today 2009, our marine corps had 202,000 active marines. today just 182,000. our ship count below the minimum 308 that the navy says needed execute its current missions. president obama plans reduce the army 450,000 troopswhich would hamstring our ability defend the united states takes years average field major new weapons system 2010, the spent $554 billion non-war base defense spending the current year are spending $548 billion cut real inflation-adjusted dollars. this reduction was done through what known the sequester automatic defense budget cuts. under the budget agreement, defense took half the cuts  even though makes only one-sixth the budget soon take office will ask congress fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit new budget rebuild our military. this will increase certainty the defense community funding, and will allow military leaders plan for our future defense needs part removing the defense sequester will ask congress fully offset the costs increased military spending the process will make government leaner and more responsive the public will ask that savings accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks  and that protect hard-earned benefits for americans. government-wide, improper government payments are estimated exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount unpaid taxes estimated high $385 billion can also reduce the size the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition  that, when employees retire, they can replaced smaller number new employees can also stop funding programs that are not authorized law. congress spent $320 billion last year 256 expired laws. removing just percent that will reduce spending almost $200 billion over years. the military will not exempt either  the military bureaucracy will have trimmed well. early term will also requesting that all nato nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. only nato countries, including the united states, are currently meeting the minimum requirement spend gdp defense. additionally will respectfully asking countries such germany, japan, south korea and saudi arabia pay more for the tremendous security provide them. finally will have our disposal additional revenues from unleashing american energy. the institute for energy research cites ""short-run"" figure much billion annually from increased energy production. using these new funds will ask secretary defense propose new defense budget meet the following long-term goals will build active army around 540,000 the army chief staff has said needs now have only brigade combat teams 490,000 troops, and only one-third combat teams are considered combat-ready will build marine corps based battalions, which the heritage foundation notes the minimum needed deal with major contingencies have now will build navy 350 surface ships and submarines recommended the bipartisan national defense panel have 276 ships now. and will build air force least,200 fighter aircraft, which the heritage foundation has shown needed execute current missions have,113 now will also seek develop state the art missile defense system. under obama-clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded the very moment the and its allies are facing heightened missile threat from states like iran and north korea these potential adversaries grow their missile programs military facilities asia and the middle east well our allies, are increasingly range, with the united states homeland also potentially threatened propose rebuild the key tools missile defense, starting with the navy cruisers that are the foundation our missile defense capabilities europe, asia, and the middle east. the obama-clinton administration tried repeatedly remove our cruisers from service, then refused modernize these aging ships will start modernizing our cruisers provide the ballistic missile defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization seek modernize significant portion these ships expand our navy toward the goal 350 ships will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed handle the missile defense mission the coming years. accomplishing this military rebuild will fifty-state effort every state the union will able take part rebuilding our military and developing the technologies tomorrow addition will improve the department defense cyber capabilities. hillary clinton has taught all how vulnerable are cyber hacking. which why one the first things must enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating the handling classified information. hillary clinton put her emails secret server cover her pay-for-play scandals the state department. nothing threatens the integrity our democracy more than when government officials put their public office for sale will also make priority develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities our. cyber command, and recruit the best and brightest americans. one first directives after taking office will asking the joint chiefs staff, and all relevant federal departments conduct thorough review united states cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure will then ask for plan immediately protect those vulnerabilities the same time will invest heavily offensive cyber capabilities disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily internet communications. these new investments cybersecurity, and the modernization our military, will spur substantial new job creation the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies tomorrow. america must the world dominant technological powerhouse the 21st century, and young americans  including our inner cities  should get these new jobs must also ensure that have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families  both when they serve, and when they return civilian life. our debt our men and women uniform eternal all those who have served this nation say will never let you down will protect those who protect. and will follow their example unity will work across all racial and income lines create one american nation. together will have one great american future will one people, under one god, saluting one american flag. america will prosperous, generous and inclusive society will discard the failed policies and division the past, and embrace true american change rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country will bring back our jobs will make america strong again will make america safe again. and will make america

"thank you great here today particular want thank. ron packard and. deborah mays for hosting their school. today are going discuss one the most important issues this campaign: school choice. but before want briefly discuss new revelations about hillary clinton emails. according the fbi report: ""the fbi did find that hostile foreign actors gained access the personal email accounts individuals with whom clinton was regular contact, and doing, obtained emails sent received clinton her personal account."" remember, hillary clinton was emailing about the drone program  among many other extremely sensitive matters. this yet more evidence that hillary clinton unfit commander-chief the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was the townhall last night, where she refused take accountability for her failed policies the middle east that have produced millions refugees, unleashed the horror radical islamic terrorism, and made less safe than ever before. throughout all, she put the entire country risk order cover her pay-for-play scandals secretary state. these include scandals like giving our uranium russia, doing favors for ubs bank, and selling contracts friends and family haiti all about hiding her criminal enterprise the clinton foundation part her criminal cover, hillary clinton staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving congressional subpoena. her staff also destroyed some her different phones with hammer. then, when she was interviewed the fbi, she claimed she couldn remember important events times. she couldn even remember whether she was trained handling classified information. she even said she didn know that the letter"" stood for confidential classified information. all the while hillary and bill raked millions dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. hillary clintons' policies produced ruin libya, iraq, and syria. she failed russia china north korea. her policies unleashed isis, spread terrorism, and put iran the path nuclear weapons  not mention the ransom payments top all, hillary clinton trigger-happy. she raced invade, intervene, and topple regimes. she believes globalism, not americanism. last night, she even falsely said american died libya. then she also falsely said there ground troops iraq, even though have,000 military personnel there right now. iraq one the biggest differences this race opposed going, and opposed the reckless way hillary clinton took out  letting isis fill the void. but was opposed the war from the beginning. long after howard stern, but three months before the iraq war started said interview with neil cavuto, that ""perhaps shouldn doing yet,"" and that ""the economy much bigger problem far the president concerned."" then march 25th 2003, just days after the war started was quoted saying the war mess,"" yet more clear evidence that had opposed the war from the start july 2003 said that would love see new york city and some the cities and some the states get some the money that going toward iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and they need badly had number quotes this effect. then august 2004, very early the conflict made detailed statement esquire magazine. ""look the war iraq and the mess that would never have handled that way. does anybody really believe that iraq going wonderful democracy where people are going run down the voting box and gently put their ballot and the winner happily going step lead the country'mon. two minutes after leave, there going revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. what was the purpose the whole thing? hundreds and hundreds young people killed. and what about the people coming back with arms and legs? not mention the other side. all those iraqi kids who been blown pieces. and turns out that all the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. all this for nothing would have been tougher terrorism. bin laden would have been caught long ago."" had been congress the time the invasion would have cast vote opposition. for years have been critic the kind reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the hallmark hillary clinton failed career. here the bottom line was private citizen had access the briefings that hillary clinton had. but iraq judgement was right and hers was wrong. hillary clinton always complaining about what wrong, but she been there for more than years and has never done anything about  all you have look new york state, when she was senator. all talk, but nothing happened track spend trillion altogether the wars iraq and afghanistan. meanwhile, massive portions our country are state disrepair time rebuild america. too many americans living our inner cities have not been included the american dream are one nation, and when any part our country hurts  our whole country hurts goal president will ensure that every child this nation  african-american, hispanic-american, all americans  will placed the ladder success great education, and great job. that ladder rests fundamental foundation: safety order help our children succeed, our first duty ensure that every kid america can grow safe community. you can have prosperity without security. this the new civil rights agenda our time. the right safe community quality education, and secure job. our campaign represents the long-awaited chance break with the bitter failures the past, and embrace new american future. there failed policy more need urgent change than our government-run education monopoly. the democratic party has trapped millions african-american and hispanic youth failing government schools that deny them the opportunity join the ladder american success time break that monopoly want every single inner city child america who today trapped failing school have the freedom  the civil right attend the school their choice. this includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must included any definition school choice. our government spends more than enough money easily pay for this initiative  with billions left over simply matter putting students first, not the education bureaucracy. let run through the numbers the state and federal level, the united states spends more than $620 billion education each year. that average about,296 for every student enrolled our elementary and secondary public schools. the federal government pays for about percent billion precise the costs. that billion makes about half the total spending the. department education. the other roughly $570 billion spent education comes from the states spend more per student than almost any other major country the world. yet, our students perform near the bottom the pack for major large advanced countries. our largest cities spend some the largest amounts money public schools. new york city spends,226 dollars per pupil. baltimore spends,287 dollars per student. chicago spends,976 dollars per student, and los angeles,602. just imagine each student these school systems was given scholarship for this amount money  allowing them and their family choose the public private school their choice. not only would this empower families, but would create massive education market that competitive and produces better outcomes. these schools would then cater the needs the individual student and family  not the needs the teachers' union. there more important job than teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms. the current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students. according the national assessment education progress, only african-american students the eighth grade are considered proficient math and reading. failing schools then contribute failing economies los angeles the official unemployment rate for african-american men almost percent baltimore percent percent chicago and percent new york city los angeles percent african american women live poverty baltimore, the poverty rate for african americans percent new york, over percent african americans live poverty. nationwide, nearly african-american children live poverty  including children under the age six. our public schools are failing put young americans path success. meanwhile have all seen the tragic rise crime these communities  which remains one the greatest barriers fostering opportunity and success for america children. violent crime rose more than los angeles 2015. homicides baltimore increased%. there have been nearly,000 victims shootings chicago far this year. government failing our citizens every level. that why proposing plan provide school choice every disadvantaged student america. that means parents will able send their kids the desired public, private religious school their choice. here how will work. right now, about billion spent fifty private school choice programs nationwide. these are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. this covers about 400,000 students our country. altogether, school choice serving more than million students nationwide. charter schools particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results providing education disadvantaged children and the success these schools will top priority for administration. they also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone first budget will immediately add additional federal investment billion towards school choice. this will done reprioritizing existing federal dollars. specifically plan will use billion existing federal dollars establish block grant for the million school age kids living poverty will give states the option allow these funds follow the student the public private school they attend. distribution this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them participate. this billion will instantly extend choice millions more students state like ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. ohio leader school choice. ohio has private school choice programs that serve over,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students. but the billion only the beginning president will establish the national goal providing school choice every american child living poverty. that means that want every disadvantaged child able choose the local public, private, charter magnet school that best for them and their family. each state will develop its own formula, but want the dollars follow the student dollars spent education spent the state and local level achieve this long-term goal will have make this shared national mission bring hope every child every city this land will use the pulpit the presidency campaign for this all states, and will call upon the american people elect officials the city, state and federal level who support school choice administration will partner with the leadership any inner city america  chicago, baltimore, detroit  that willing run pilot program provide school choice every child that community baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than,000 funds available per student confident that the politicians will not able suppress the will the people anymore can put man the moon, dig out the panama canal, and win two world wars, then have doubt that nation, can provide school choice every disadvantaged child america the states collectively contribute another $110 billion their own education budgets toward school choice top the billion federal dollars, that could provide,000 school choice funds every student who today lives poverty. the money will follow the student. that means the student will able attend the public, private, charter magnet school their choice  and each state will develop its own system that works best for them your president will the nation biggest cheerleader for school choice understand many stale old politicians will resist. but time for our country start thinking big once again spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead will also support merit-pay for teachers that reward great teachers  instead the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones the same time have ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college policies will add millions new jobs our country, especially for our african-american and hispanic communities plan lift restrictions the production american energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but will add estimated half million jobs per year reducing radical regulation and over-taxation can bring thousands new companies into our poorest communities. crucially trade reforms will create manufacturing revival america have nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world  that money coming straight out states like ohio, pennsylvania, michigan, maine, and many others ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices will able open thousands new plants and factories across america. the future filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children. all have cut our ties with the failed politics the past had failed foreign policy failed education policy failed economic policy. and, underneath all failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have how many journalists they know  not how many americans they help live better lives. but the failures the past are about end. those failures end beginning november 8th will have one american nation will one american people are fighting give every child every forgotten stretch this country, the chance live out their dreams safety and peace. that means safe neighborhood quality education, and secure high-paying job. this how will rebuild our future. this how will make america great again  for everyone. thank you.

the issue school choice. cheers and  and can possibly emphasize this enough. millions poor and disadvantaged students are trapped failing schools. this education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more than the african-american community  none. the democratic party has run the inner cities america for years, some cases over hundred years  over hundred years. their policies and their politics, and particular the politics people like hillary clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime. when she was running for the senate new york state, she said she was going produce jobs, jobs, jobs upstate new york disaster. she going produce jobs, big thing  jobs going bring back jobs. been catastrophe lost tens thousands jobs. she never did thing was all talk action, just like what she doing right now all talk action. she talk and talk, and nothing will happen. only bad will happen. but you just have ask the people upstate new york. she won because them, and she

agenda, and goal provide every single inner-city child america that trapped failing government school the freedom attend the school their choice. competition  the schools the schools will get better and better and better. cheers and  and that means private school religious school charter school magnet school. school choice also means that parents can home-school their children. cheers and  hundred percent. hillary clinton opposes school choice because she controlled totally, totally, like puppet special interests. her policies will force millions african-american and hispanic children remain stuck failed government schools, leading higher unemployment and more poverty. the poverty levels this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete provide the best services for our children    including every african-american and hispanic child this country, every single one them. cheers and  this proposal begins with billion block grant from the federal government for states pursue school choice programs.  however  that good, right?  however, because percent education spending the state level will campaign get the states reallocate another $110 billion their education budgets school choice programs this, that would mean,000 school choice funds for every disadvantaged student america. what difference this going make. the money will follow the student the public, private religious school that best for them and their family many ways, you going have choice administration will partner with the leadership any inner-city  anybody  anybody the inner cities america willing run pilot program  and there will lot them provide school choice every child that community baltimore, for instance, that would

education can get worse. commo core going end. cheers and bringing education local will fight for every child this country who deserve better futures. the african-american community has heard message that going make the inner city safe again, and going bring back jobs, and going bring back the great education. don surprised  remember this, november 8th  don surprised, because have been given lot support over the last three four weeks november 8th get more african-american and hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about month ago. you see what going? cheers and  they starting  people are starting hear about this. and they saying, wow. wow. they liking. and again, can get any worse going get lot better. but only. they can. the democrats, they have  what they done incredible. and hillary clinton will absolutely more the same  rigid never change. remember hundred years years not going change. not going happen. now, let talk about another issue that will define the future this country for generations come, the united states supreme court. cheers and  earlier this year lost the great justice, antonin scalia. the next president will not only have fill this seat, but many four others could even mean could end with total five judges one president would record-setting. probably three. could four. could even five. and you pick the wrong people, you have country that longer your country will disaster. one the most important issues, frankly  other than maybe defense, because going build our military depleted. cheers and going take care our vets going protect your second amendment many things. but one the most important  some people think actually the most important the filling the seats, united states supreme court. you see what happening right now? essentially four and four. and you see what  how bad going pick great judges already put list federalist society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews these people. and are going put truly great people. maybe use judge scalia the ultimate example what looking for? cheers and  this will determine whether not remain constitutional republic, frankly. that what going happen have pledged appoint judges who uphold the constitution protect your religious liberty, and apply the law written. cheers and reject judges who rewrite the constitution impose their own person views 300 million-plus americans not going have that made public list judges said, that will guide selection process. hillary clinton has refused provide such list. and brought. let see list. you ever saw the list you would walk out here not feeling very well. laughter because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would rejected the overwhelming majority the american public. they rejected. clinton judicial picks would allow her completely take over american health care, the american economy, and americans religious liberty  not mention your second amendment, which very thin ice right now you know, because the fact that four-and-four they even pick one judge who wrong you can probably you know  you can kiss the second amendment goodbye. and don want see that. another issue this race great importance everyone this room the issue course national security. just today was announced that north korea performed its fifth nuclear test  its fourth since hillary clinton became secretary state just one more massive failure from failed secretary state. cheers and  failed everything. her policies have also put iran onto path nuclear weapons, and have say made them overnight absolute power. they were dying three years ago. the sanctions were choking them. they would have fallen. but obama didn support people that would have taken over, and think this case probably would have taken over the right way; had support. but you look what happened iran such short period time. but remember the ransom payments. remember was $400 million two weeks ago. but then they made mistake. this cash. remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn open bank account. there was way sending into checking account. laughter all lies, just like obamacare was big lie, remember? you can use your plan. you can use your doctors times, right? twenty-seven times. you can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out lie all lie all big lie rigged system and lie. and tell you what tell you what. the 400 million dollars, for those that haven been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out billion dollars cash  cash. and actually said  they said, that money going used for terror said, they don need for terror. they got 150 billion dollars. that addition the $150 billion that giving back said they don need. this going into their swiss accounts and going into their accounts. they not going use for terror. they have plenty money for terror. think billion dollars cash  massive, big vats cash. you saw them  cartons never saw anything like seen lot cash. laughter hey, never saw anything like this billion dollars. can you imagine these guys? planes get  they stop. remember, they wouldn give back the hostages. they waited there for hours and hours. and obama kept saying, this has nothing  even the hostages said they kept waiting for certain plane come, not take them back, because they were waiting for something was this  just another lie. but can you imagine these people sitting there and they see billion dollars cash, yai, yai. they think stupid. laughter they think stupid. they won thinking for long. cheers and  very sad. cheers and the same time, isis hunting down and exterminating what calls the nation the cross. isis carrying out genocide against christians the middle east cannot let this evil continue  can let. cheers and  isis must destroyed  have; have choice defeat isis must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare whole different ballgame today than was years ago and 200 years ago  different world must also establish bipartisan goal the united states and international goal with our allies defeating radical islamic terrorism  cheers and   words that our president won use and words that hillary clinton won use. just like won the cold war identifying our enemy and building consensus guide long-term strategy too must the same with islamic terrorism the way, president obama has allowed syrian refugees pour into our country unbelievable rates. and hillary clinton wants allow 550 percent more. but almost impossible get christian from syria. they take others, but they don take christians  very, very, very rare said that need make safe zones the region want take care people. but absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat continue, and have stop this. this going potentially catastrophe for our country from within. this could the all-time great trojan horse. this could. you ever notice the  you look the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. cellphones. and some the cellphones have the isis flag printed them. and some them have things far worse than that  scenes far worse than that was the failed policies, you have remember hillary clinton and obama that unleashed isis the first place they did the right thing, you wouldn talking about isis right now.  now she wants get rid going get rid them. you know, she tells them already there will boots the ground. now, even you don want boots the ground, you don want say. don say! now they saying hope she wins, boy, would they dream having her president. can you  laughter  they dream about every night, having hillary clinton. but even you believe  and can understand that boots the ground can understand. you don say! let them think they going through hell. don say! cheers and  can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur, can you imagine the great general george patton one our great generals that have today  general flynn, who here someplace  cheers and love general flynn  but can you imagine these people saying mean, they basically giving out the strategy: there will boots the ground you don want that fully understand. don say! don say! could you imagine macarthur saying going fight the enemy, and going move our troops about month going hit from behind? laughter going hit them from the front, then  and everything they say turns out true? you know hate say this because have lot evangelicals this room, but maybe shouldn honest when comes military strategy. does that make sense? laughter and  hope didn lose your vote for saying that.  just look what her policies have left with iraq, syria and libya. the problem hillary clinton trigger-happy. she really. she trigger-happy, and yet she says boots, which sort  probably will boots, you know. probably will turn out another disaster tenure has brought only war and destruction and death. she just too quick intervene, invade push for regime change with people don even know who they are. and they take over, and they far worse. this creates the power vacuums that are filled terrorist and groups like isis administration the other hand, will work with any country that willing partner with defeat isis and halt radical islamic terrorism. and the way, that includes russia they want join knocking out isis, that just fine far concerned. cheers and very imperfect world, and you can always choose your friends. that life. but you can never fail recognize your enemies have some real enemies. unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into hillary clinton emails. these are the same emails she destroyed after receiving federal subpoena. what that? using software order bleach the emails you can never, ever see them. she even mysteriously lost different phones before the fbi got them, and many were destroyed with hammer. laughter did anybody ever hit hammer  you know, maybe two three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. laughter can you believe this? destroyed them with hammer  the old-fashioned way guess. laughter the other night the commander chief forum  did anybody see that? cheers and  how did? cheers good. well have big debate coming. who knows what going happen there? but will say, every poll has winning big league the commander chief. cheers and had  the polls came out after that event and won big league. now have debate coming don imagine any you going watching the debate, right? laughter and cheers audience member: don take her bait. don take her bait. trump won promise. hillary clinton answered questions her emails horribly. that why she lost. that why she did poorly. she was terrible. she was  honestly shouldn saying this  she was terrible. laughter she keeps talking about the emails. every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. laughter seems each week, true, she has, like different answer. but there can answer when she deletes,000 emails, bleaches them they can never recovered unheard practice  hammers them into total silence. you know what happening. you know what happening always say, getting away with that will the single greatest accomplishment her career. laughter and cheers true true. cheers and her answers were bad. they were bad. and lot people said they were totally dishonest. and you know, she was blaming matt lauer thought matt lauer did very good job mean, his questions were very tough.  but the gentleman who stood and said: honestly, you should prison for what you did  jeers, that was the tough one. laughter that was the tough  hey, that was tough question. laughter

let open making this very important declaration love this state love the people this state, and together are going have amazing victory november. decades political failure and corruption will come swiftly end, and new american future will begin. the citizens this country will charge once more. the special interests have had their day. that chapter our history closing. the history book closing the failed politicians yesterday new chapter beginning, and this chapter will authored you, the american people. this will your time. you will running the show. not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives. once more will have government and for the people. all have cut our ties the bitter failures the past, and anything becomes possible. change coming. all the people who rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop your turn now. this your time. the fact that many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign the best proof you will ever need that are fighting for real change  not partisan change are fighting for all americans  democrats, republicans, independents, conservatives, liberals  who been failed this corrupt system fighting for everyone who doesn have voice also fighting for every region this country. for every part florida, and every part america. from pensacola pittsburgh, from baltimore baton rouge are fighting for every last city and every last person this country. hillary clinton the candidate the past. ours the campaign the future this future are going pursue new trade policies that put american workers first  and that keep jobs our country. all the people who got nafta wrong, and china wrong, and who are trying give the trans-pacific partnership  are the same failed voices pushing for hillary clinton. our trade deficit with the world now nearly $800 billion dollars lost one-third our manufacturing jobs since bill and hillary clinton gave nafta. china manipulating its currency and taking our jobs are going stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here america. the era economic surrender over will also have very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and going build border wall, and mexico will pay for this new future are going raise your wages. household incomes are over,000 less today than they were the year 2000 tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages. hillary clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich your personal expense. many people this room tonight, and across this country, haven seen real wage increase years. the people getting rich off our rigged system have sent tens millions dollars hillary clinton  much her personal bank account keep you from having the future you deserve. but november 8th, you get vote for the future you want this future are going pursue new education policies the center plan school choice want every disadvantaged child america able attend the public private school that right for them and their family this future are also going keep our country out the endless wars that have defined hillary clinton career keep our country out war will remember those three very famous words: peace through strength. that means rebuilding our badly depleted military laid out detailed plan this week-invest our military and our troops are going build 350 ship navy 540,000 soldier army air force,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and marine core built battalions. crucially are also going pursue state-the-art missile defense will start modernizing our cruisers provide the ballistic missile defense capability our nation needs expand our navy toward the goal 350 ships will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed handle the missile defense mission the coming years. just today were reminded the need for missile defense after north korea performed its fourth nuclear test since hillary clinton became secretary state. one more massive hillary clinton failure. just like she failed iran and put them the path nuclear weapons. hillary clinton has presided over the greatest series foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. her policies have produced massive global disorder. she handed iraq over isis, unleashing that terror group onto the world. isis would not threatening the west today not for the decisions hillary clinton made. she helped destabilize egypt supporting the ouster president mubarak exchange for the muslim brotherhood. fortunately, president-sisi now charge, but terrorists have gained foothold that country. she helped push syria into prolonged civil war pushing regime change that country too  without any plan for the day after. she failed with china, which has only grown more aggressive the way, she also let china steal hundreds billions dollars our intellectual property. and course, hillary clinton failed with her russian reset. she gave missile defense poland and the czech republic exchange for nothing return. then, she gave. uranium russia while those who benefited from the deal gave money the clintons. let not forget, russia went into crimea president obama watch. unlike clinton and obama will negotiate with russia from position strength  not weakness. and weakness all get from president obama and hillary clinton. the difference between and opponent vladimir putin, and all negotiations that negotiate creating leverage can extract good deal for the united states. hillary clinton negotiates but never gets anything value for the united states. putin laughs our leaders, and takes them the cleaners again and again. that why will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position leadership the world can negotiate from position great strength once again cannot get good deal for the united states will follow the example ronald reagan and walk away. that completely contrary the way president obama and hillary clinton negotiate which gets nothing value for the united states, ever. they just keep losing will end this legacy failure and strongly defend the interests the united states. but will also keep focused the ultimate goal will not seek endless conflict and hostility won get trapped the failed approaches the past future where america can find common ground with countries like russia and china better future for our children will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and clear understanding our many, many differences will advocate the american position with strength and clarity president obama and hillary clinton never have more apology tours more bowing foreign powers proudly defend america every single turn. america will get the respect deserves. and don will walk away from the deal like you never seen anyone walk before. and, believe, within short while, they will come back -- but only terms, therefore the terms the american people these principles will pursue our long-term goals peace  for the sake our kids, and for the sake the world future. hillary clinton has failed every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and very high price for the world. her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. she trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change  but never creating promoting stability advancing the core interests the united states. her only real achievement secretary state has been getting away with her massive email scandal. she bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after subpoena from congress. she lied congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with hammer keep them from getting authorities the way, who has thirteen phones the first place? only somebody with whole lot hide. and all know what hillary clinton was hiding. she was hiding her pay-for-play scandals secretary state. hillary clinton isn just part the corrupt establishment, she the corrupt establishment just saw her press conference today where hillary clinton complained about all the problems the world only had competent secretary state who could have prevented all these problems from happening. throughout all, hillary clinton and her foundation raked millions and millions dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes earth. hillary clinton and her foundation have cozied regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights unimaginable scale administration will voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions women being oppressed radical islam. hillary clinton has been there for years and produced only failure. yet people keep giving her money and protecting her the powerful protecting the powerful. the insiders fighting for insiders fighting for you. all the people advising hillary clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies the middle east proud have the support the retired generals and admirals who know how win  and how avoid endless war. let also take this moment express our deepest thanks and gratitude everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country. there greater expression love than the love shown the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people our duty ensure that their sacrifices are not vain. that means don issue timetables for political reasons, but that work with our generals and our leaders produce real plan for victory will pursue new, steady foreign policy that seeks advance the national security interests the united states  not reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country badly. and will clear naming our enemy: radical islamic terrorism. the fact that hillary clinton can even say these words proves how unfit she lead this country. this one single fact she can never escape. any country that shares our goal defeating this enemy will our partner this mission will break the cycle regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone for many years simply can afford continue down the road are right now. that applies everything. change needed every single level our society. when talk about making america great again talking about creating future that includes each and every american want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society have ever had. the possibilities for our future are unlimited. the hillary clinton campaign small petty tired just break from this bitter, divisive past can achieve anything. that also means breaking from the lies and the deceit the clintons. they want scare you out voting for change. the most recent smear comes from bill clinton, who said that the theme make america great again somehow racist  now they unearthed video footage bill clinton repeatedly using this same phrase just one more clinton lie, one more desperate slander keep the people from having the future they deserve. when talk about making america great again talking about making great again for everyone  but especially for all the americans who have been left behind are the campaign unity, and will deliver amazing things for all our people. new schools, new factories, new infrastructure. beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation will develop detroit, not beijing. most importantly will fight end the systemic poverty our inner cities, and lift millions african-americans and hispanics out poverty. here florida have such amazing and diverse community hispanic-americans  from cuba, from puerto rico, from venezuela, from haiti, from all over. these incredible americans will have donald. trump president who determined fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures all hispanic-americans who want better jobs and higher wages will your champion. all working people all backgrounds and from all places, will have true friend donald trump particular have very special place heart for those who make living tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers spent professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than wall street executives. there reason the hedge fund managers are funding hillary clinton campaign, and not mine campaign powered own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all you who just want their country back. this our chance our last chance give the people control over their own futures once again. gleaming new plants stretching across our nation. young latino children getting amazing education the school their choice  and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition. our veterans will get the best healthcare the world. you can read the whole plan our website, donaldjtrump.com. massive tax reductions and tax simplification that you can keep more your precious time and your hard-earned money. hillary clinton wants raise your taxes big time. most importantly, 2017 will about unity. once again will one american nation will one american people. just imagine what can accomplish together set aside our differences, and focus what have common americans will one people, living under one god, saluting one beautiful american flag will make america proud again will make america prosperous again will make america safe again. friends and fellow citizens will make america great again!

and alarmed this friday hear opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign. our support comes from every part america, and every walk life have the support cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions working class families who just want better future. these were the people hillary clinton viciously demonized. these were among the countless americans that hillary clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and-american. she called these patriotic men and women every vile name the book  she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and islamaphobic. she called them ""basket deplorables both speech and interview. she divides people into baskets though they were objects, not human beings. hillary

citizens first must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics the past and pursue future where every american honored and respected have reject the arrogance washington. that looks down everyday hardworking people. too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes those who don have political power. those leadership must put themselves the shoes the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security the mom struggling afford childcare. that means need working mothers fairly compensated for their work, and have access affordable, quality child care for their kids want higher pay, better wages, and growing economy for everyone. these solutions must update laws passed more than half century ago when most women were still not the labor force. today, nearly mothers with young children have jobs. for many families our country, childcare now the single largest expense  even more than housing. yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done this area  and opponent has childcare plan. many americans are just one crisis away from disaster sick kid lost job damaged home. there financial security. but that will all change

families with stay-home parent will able fully deduct the average cost child care from their taxes. for low-income individuals who have net income tax liability will offer expanded earned income tax credit eitc the form childcare rebate. working parents can get expanded eitc benefit that equals half their total payroll tax major relief for low-income parents. this translates much extra,200 dollars eitc benefits for working families. next, our plan allows every parent america open dependent care savings account. families can contribute,000 dollars year these accounts completely tax-free. crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will available all americans  you won have depend your employer provide them. immediate family and employers can also contribute dependent account, each which designated for specific child, including unborn child. the money that put into these accounts can also spent not only child care, but also child enrichment activities. additionally, the funds these accounts not expire the end the year  they don revert employers the treasury. instead, the funds rollover while only,000 dollars can contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings. these savings can then used parents help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute the school choice reforms outlined last week. the funds will remain the account until the age. whatever still remains that time can used help offset the costs higher education. for low-income individuals, the federal government will provide

allowing these parents have their earned income tax credit funds directly deposited into their dependent care savings accounts. these dependent care savings accounts can also set provide care for elderly dependents. our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform incentivize private sector solutions. the new funds offered our plan will create new market for innovative childcare solutions.

minutes commute time. currently, only employers provide these services. our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies pool resources provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit. finally, our plan offers crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers not provide paid maternity leave. this solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will completely self-financing recapturing fraud and improper payments the unemployment insurance program can provide weeks paid-maternity leave

"thank you for the opportunity speak with you. today going outline plan for american economic revival bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people our country plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under minimum government burden, and will tap into the incredible unrealized potential our workers and their dreams. right now million americans are the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part our economy silent nation jobless americans. look further than the city flint, where just visited. the jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed 1970, there were more than,000 people flint working for  today less than,000. now ford has announced moving all small car production mexico used cars were made flint and you couldn drink the water mexico. now, the cars are made mexico and you can drink the water flint are going turn this around economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow did once before reject the pessimism that says our standard living can longer rise, and that all that left divide and redistribute our shrinking resources. everything that broken today can fixed, and every failure can turned into great success. jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring. failing schools can become flourishing schools. crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. inner cities can experience flood new jobs and investment. and rising crime can give way safe and prosperous communities. all these things, and much more, are possible. but accomplish them must replace the present policy globalism  which has moved many jobs and much wealth out our country  and replace with new policy americanism. under this american system, every policy decision make must pass simple test: does create more jobs and better wages for americans lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure american energy, and negotiate trade deals that put america first, then there limit the number jobs can create and the amount prosperity can unleash. america will truly the greatest place the world invest, hire, grow and create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries. instead driving jobs and wealth away, america will become the world great magnet for innovation and job creation opponent plan rejects this optimism. she offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution future slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. the only people who get rich under hillary clinton scheme are the donors and the special interests hillary clinton america have surrendered our status the world great economy, and have surrendered our middle class the whims foreign countries. not one single idea she has will create one net american job create one new dollar american wealth for our workers. the only thing she can ever offer welfare check. our plan will produce paychecks, and they going great paychecks for millions people now unemployed the course this campaign have travelled all across this country and met the most amazing people. every day seen the goodness and character our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances many parts our country, the hard times never seem end visited cities and towns upstate new york where half the jobs have left and moved other countries. politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there. worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain these wonderful americans opponent described tens millions american citizens deplorable and irredeemable  how can hillary clinton seek lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption? the hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and latinos  but above everything else, they are all american. they love their families, they love their country, and they want better future. these are the forgotten men and women america. people who work hard but don have voice running their voice, and fight bring prosperity every part this country. too many our leaders have forgotten that their duty protect the jobs, wages and well-being american workers before any other consideration not running president the world running president the united states  and your president will fight for every last american job are the nation that tamed the west, dug out the panama canal, won two world wars, and put man the moon time start thinking big once again. that why believe time establish national goal reaching% economic growth working with economic team put together plan that puts track achieve that goal. over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average% growth and create total million new jobs. you can visit our website see the math. this growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will completely paid-for combination with proposed budget savings will deficit neutral reach% growth will reduce the deficit will accomplished through complete overhaul our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies. right now, under obama-clinton policies, the economy grew only percent last quarter  that translates millions lost jobs. this the weakest-called recovery since the great depression. over the last years, the economy grew only percent, the slowest period seventy years. had the economy grown under obama the same rate reagan would have meant million more jobs. perhaps most shockingly men aged are either jail out work. meanwhile, another million hispanic-americans have been added the ranks those poverty top all, the obama-clinton policies have doubled the national debt took more than 230 years for the united states accumulate first trillion dollars debt took president obama only eight years add another trillion. now would one thing that money had been used completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure. instead, the opposite happened doubled our debt and return have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools badly depleted military, and another million people who have left the workforce. never has much money been spent poorly. but going turn that all around. here how begins with bold new tax reform outlined detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number brackets from. the new brackets will and, but low-income americans will pay income tax all fact, our plan will remove millions and millions workers from the income tax rolls entirely lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process will add millions new jobs addition, because have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will concentrated the working and middle class taxpayer. they will receive the biggest benefit won even close. this working and middle class tax relief proposal. the tax relief for these workers will expanded childcare proposals that have worked with daughter, ivanka. these proposals are central element our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. families will able fully deduct the average cost childcare from their taxes, including stay-home parents. because this deduction capped will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. the less you make, the larger share your income you can exclude from taxation. parents will also able enroll tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children elderly relatives. low-income households will benefit from both expanded earned income tax credit the form childcare rebate  and matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts married couple earning,000 per year with two children and,000 child care expenses will save% from their current tax bill married couple earning,000 per year with two children and,000 child care expenses will receive% reduction their tax bill contrast, someone earning million will receive virtually change their tax bill all. one our greatest job creation measures going our% business tax rate  down from the current% rate reduction more than percent explosion new business and new jobs will created will amazing watch will also allow.-based manufacturers fully expense the cost new plants and equipment top that will bring back trillions business wealth parked overseas and tax% rate. some people say there are trillion dollars overseas think trillion taxing% instead%, all this money will come back into our country will turn america into magnet for new jobs  and that means jobs our poorest communities. next, comes regulations. one the keys unlocking growth scaling-back years disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed our out-control bureaucracy. regulations have grown into massive, job-killing industry  and the regulation industry one business will put end 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over,300 final rules and regulations from,400 the prior year. every year, overregulation costs our economy trillion dollars year and reduces household wealth almost,000 dollars proposed moratorium new federal regulations that are not compelled congress public safety, and will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now the books. this includes eliminating some our most intrusive regulations, like the waters the. rule also means scrapping the epa-called clean power plan which the government itself estimates will cost billion year. this obama-clinton directive will shut down most not all, coal-powered electricity plans america. remember what hillary clinton said? she wants shut down the miners, just like she wants shut down the steel mills going put our great miners and steel workers back work. energy reform central our plan well according the heritage foundation 2030, president obama energy restrictions will eliminate another half million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output trillion dollars, and reduce incomes,000 dollars per person. hillary clinton wants even further, and her plan could cost the economy trillion dollars trump administration will lift restrictions all sources american energy production. according the institute for american energy resources this will: increase gdp more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages more than billion over the next years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues almost trillion over decades increase total economic activity more than trillion over the next years addition will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions dollars projects held president obama  creating countless more jobs the process. finally, comes trade  the foundation for everything america annual trade deficit with the world now nearly $800 billion year enormous drag growth. between world war and the year 2000, the united states averaged% growth rate. but, after china joined the world trade organization, our average growth rate has been reduced only percent. predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions jobs and trillions wealth from our country great secret that many the special interests funding opponent campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. the same-called experts advising hillary clinton are the same people who gave nafta, china entry into the world trade organization, the job-killing trade deal with south korea, and now the trans-pacific partnership. the verdict. all the special interests that the media race for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they promoted  every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks reality. our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were the year 2000 have proposed detailed plan reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth america. this includes the following steps going direct the secretary commerce identify every violation trade agreements foreign country currently using harm our workers will use every tool under american and international law end these abuses, and will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators  and know who you are, many you are the room are going start with nafta, which causing much damage our country will entirely renegotiate nafta into deal that will either good for will terminated until brand new and productive deal can signed are also going keep america out the trans-pacific partnership. next going instruct treasury secretary label china currency manipulator, and apply tariffs any country that devalues its currency gain unfair advantage over the united states going instruct the. trade representative bring trade cases against china. china unfair subsidy behavior prohibited the terms its entrance the wto, and intend enforce those rules china does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft american trade secrets and intellectual property will apply countervailing duties until china ceases and desists. just the single action enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions new american jobs. according the. international trade commission, improved protection america intellectual property china would add million jobs year the united states every single year are going stop the outflow jobs from our country, and open new highway jobs back into our country. here how the plan adds are proposing trillion tax cut that will score trillion under dynamic growth model, which how taxes should scored. this includes the childcare plan. our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave least another trillion off the remaining cost. that leaves around $800 billion dollars. this money can all saved through simple, common sense reforms save just one penny each federal dollar spent non-defense, and non-entitlement programs can save almost trillion over the next decade  again this spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements our plan exceeds the% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. savings will compounded the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment welfare will finally able find jobs. this the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps the history our country. this what our new future will look like going lower you taxes going get rid massive amounts unnecessary regulations business and your life going unleash american energy going repeal and replace obamacare going appoint justices the supreme court who will follow the constitution going rebuild our depleted military and take care our vets going save your 2nd amendment going stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes will build the wall mexico will pay; and going renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially nafta  and will only make great trade deals that put the american worker first. and are going put our miners and our steelworkers back work will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. american cars will travel the roads, american planes will soar the skies, and american ships will patrol the seas. american steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. american hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy, harvested from american sources, will power this nation. american workers will hired the job will put new american metal into the spine this country. jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back our shores will make america wealthy again will make america strong again. and will make america great again. thank you, and god bless!

racists the oldest play the democratic play book  and americans have had enough. they want solutions, and they want better lives  not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.

for all americans, and will campaign for every last vote every last community will extend hand every mayor this country who wants partner making our cities safer for their citizens. but this must work with our police  not against our police. those peddling the narrative cops racist force our society narrative supported with nod opponent  share directly the responsibility for the unrest that afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least. low-income african-americans these communities are the ones suffering terms lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives people have been shot the city chicago alone since friday. the problem not that there are too many police. the problem that there are not enough police. police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and must everything can ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members the public, and that any wrongdoing always vigorously addressed. but our men and women blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. they are the line separating civilization from chaos. hillary clinton does not have worry about the sirens and the gunshots night the poor family living the inner city the mother who feels like refugee her own country. who there represent these families? hillary clinton doesn want hear their voices will their voice, and will voice for all the forgotten americans this country. people who just want secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and good-paying job support their loved ones will bring security our african-american communities,

agenda can summed three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs opponent likes say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."" that she has been ""fighting for children."" why then are million american women and children living poverty the brink poverty? why has she provided relief for the millions americans search affordable, reliable quality childcare? you know the old saying, ""watch what, not what say the trump organization, and campaign for president, women occupy some the highest positions have employed thousands women company. women different backgrounds. women many talents. and just last week here pennsylvania was joined daughter, ivanka, and laid out plan for childcare and eldercare have also talked about improving education, and will talk about more tonight first-class public school education well options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling right, not privilege. the opportunity attend two four-year college pursue trade skill set through vocational and technical education, should easier access, pay for, and finish. education the bedrock our society. women also value security. they want commander-chief that will defeat radical islamic terrorism and protect our borders campaign across this country hear many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. they are doing their best their communities and for their families provide safe and nurturing environment. but even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge drugs lose thousands our fellow americans every year opioid use will stop the drug inflow from our borders. these drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs. this must change. every change starts with conversation. together will have this conversation. and will make this change. the changes will start immediately first day office going immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses. this will unleash technology revolution. america will become the best place innovate and invest the future. the next great american invention, the next great improvement our lives right around the corner. all have remove the red tape. our plan includes one the biggest tax reforms american history going include% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country magnet for new jobs are going unleash american energy revolution. oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. this

single violation our trading rules our foreign competitors will apply every lawful remedy end these trade abuses. steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will returning pennsylvania very big way. your state has lost one-third your manufacturing jobs since nafta, and one-fourth your manufacturing jobs since china joined the world trade organization. these were both bill clinton deals backed hillary clinton. the clintons robbed pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them other countries are going bring them back. jobs will come flowing back all over america used that cars were made flint and you couldn drink the water mexico. today, the cars are made mexico and you can drink the water flint going turn all around. there reason the hedge fund managers are all donating hillary clinton campaign  and not mine. everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing change, are throwing their money hillary clinton campaign powered own money, and small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens our donors are small dollar donations. every dollar helps deliver your country back you  visit donaldjtrump.com find out how you can help our movement. let tell you what else going. one the biggest problems facing young people and families today the cost college education. the cost college has increased over 500% since 1973. but what lot people don know that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. these huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many these universities don use the money help with tuition and student debt. instead, these universities use the money pay their administrators put donors' names buildings just store the money away fact, many universities spend more private equity fund managers than tuition programs. but they should using the money the students  for tuition, for student life, and for student housing top that, the federal government spends over billion higher education every year, plus another $130 billion federal loans. here again, the universities don use the money reduce the price college  but increase have break this cycle going work with congress reforms make sure that universities want access all these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars  paid for you  that they are making good faith effort reduce the cost college and student debt, and spend their endowments their own students. another major issue for all american families healthcare. president obama promised obamacare would reduce the cost healthcare,500 dollars. instead, the opposite happened  the cost healthcare has increased nearly,000 dollars during that time. just one more washington lie  like the lie that you like your doctor you can keep your doctor disaster. that why first day going ask congress immediately send bill repeal and replace disastrous obamacare are going replace government-run obamacare with reforms that put patients first. these reforms include expanding access popular healthcare savings accounts, empowering americans shop for the insurance their choice across state lines, and block granting medicaid the states they can design innovative solutions best serve our most vulnerable citizens. hillary clinton the other hand, wants give obamacare illegal immigrants and wants total government takeover healthcare. her plan also gives social security and medicare illegal immigrants making them citizens  bankrupting these programs for americans. she doesn understand how democracy works. public servants are just that  they there serve you. but the only people hillary clinton has ever served are the special interests. our campaign about breaking the special interest monopoly washington trying disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. they all part the same political establishment. they the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. they all support the same ideology globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth other countries not running president the world running president the united states for america  and america first. together will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams. government will start working again. fixing things what. just look projects new york, where turned rundown spaces into new centers business, activity and opportunity  where others saw only problems saw only potential turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands workers and families. that what want for our country want into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches this nation, and unlock their potential for all our people made living for years looking unused spaces and imagining what they could. politicians look blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses look those same neighborhoods and offer solutions spend much time thinking about how things used stopped thinking about how great things could  all have tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers are nation strivers, dreamers, and believers  and that the spirit that will carry victory november, and great victories nation that same spirit resilience have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns louisiana meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people cities and towns like flint, michigan that spirit strength will need start winning again country. but that means you need show and vote november 8th. you have knock doors. you have pick that phone our

"good morning. thank you, christine, for that kind introduction also want thank the marcellus shale coalition, the ohio oil and gas association, and the west virginia oil and natural gas association for inviting join you here today. your organizations represent tens thousands jobs for hardworking americans. let also recognize friend, harold hamm great here pittsburgh, the steel city. under trump administration are going bring back our steel jobs and are going rebuild this nation. before going any further today want address the turmoil unfolding right now our country. our country desperately needs unity, and needs the spirit togetherness that has not only got through our toughest times  but which has lifted the past our greatest achievements nation. every day see people different backgrounds working together for common good, and need bring that spirit every part our country  and become one american nation, united our shared values and principles american citizens all have walk mile someone else shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get work fixing our wounded country. many americans are watching the unrest charlotte unfolding their screens. others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. our country looks bad the world, especially when are supposed the leader. how can lead when can even control our own cities honor and recognize the right all americans peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. but there right engage violent disruption threaten the public safety and peace. every single american this country entitled live safe community. the violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must brought end. the people who will suffer the most result these riots, are law-abiding african-american residents who live these communities their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer  and the first duty government protect their well-being and safety. there compassion tolerating lawless conduct. crime and violence attack the poor, and will never accepted trump administration. our job not make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but make life more comfortable for the african-american parent trying raise their kids peace. for every one violent protestor, there are thousands moms and dads and kids that same community who just want able sleep safely night. more law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing what our country needs. last year saw% rise violent crime our fifty largest cities. homicides are nearly washington. and more than baltimore. more than,000 have been shot chicago far this year alone. nationwide, approximately murder victims under the age are african-american. this national crisis, and the job the next president work with our governors and mayors address this crisis and save african-american lives. look the example mayor rudy giuliani new york. the policies put into place ultimately brought down crime percent and murder percent. think how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable need national anti-crime agenda make our cities safe again will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers the country dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates  and will stop the drugs from flowing into our country administration will work with local communities and local officials make the reduction crime top priority. safety the foundation the ladder american success great education, and good-paying job have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities. that means must recognize the contributions our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives protect the innocent all remember, earlier this year, when officers dallas  hunted down for execution  continued protecting the public until their last moments earth. every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many them will out calls and never return. police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and must everything can ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members the public, and that any wrongdoing always vigorously addressed. but our men and women blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. they are the line separating civilization from total chaos. they are also the front lines defense the war terror saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks new jersey, and new york, and the off-duty police officer heroic actions minnesota addition providing safety must provide economic opportunity. that begins with school choice, and leads secure job with rising income. this brings the subject energy. producing more american energy central part plan making america wealthy again  especially for the poorest americans. america sitting treasure trove untapped energy  some trillion dollars shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas federal lands addition hundreds years coal energy reserves all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices going lift the restrictions american energy, and allow this wealth pour into our communities  including right here pennsylvania. according the institute for energy research, lifting the restrictions american energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following: increase gdp more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages more than billion over the next years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues almost trillion over decades increase total economic activity more than trillion over the next years addition will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions dollars projects held president obama  creating countless more jobs the process. overall entire economic plan  tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform  will create least million new jobs over the next years, assuming average growth rate percent, and believe will reach% growth tax plan includes fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from percent today  turning america into jobs magnet. hillary clinton would raise taxes some small businesses high percent. income taxes will simplified from brackets, and middle class americans will get major tax cut  including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts plan includes the elimination all unnecessary regulations, and temporary moratorium new regulations not compelled congress public safety. overregulation costing our economy trillion year energy economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies both today and tomorrow. finally plan includes renegotiation america trade deals, and the enforcement trade rules increase jobs and wealth inside the united states. strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions the long-term perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan american history. compare that opponent. she plans trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring american jobs, and the aggressive restriction american energy production. her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system. hillary clinton wants put the coal miners out work, ban hydraulic fracturing most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production public lands and most offshore areas. this will produce devastation for states like pennsylvania, ohio, and west virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts the economy. her plan hurts states like colorado, florida, virginia, north carolina, and any anywhere with access either onshore offshore energy resources. she also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that needed move our energy resources the marketplace. according the wall street journal, ""overall, more than dozen fossil fuel projects, worth about billion, have been either rejected regulators withdrawn developers since 2012, with billions more tied projects still regulatory limbo."" examples energy transportation projects blocked abandoned include $850 million coal export facility washington billion natural gas pipeline the northeast, and billion liquid natural gas export facility, among others. billions dollars private infrastructure investment have been lost the obama-clinton restriction agenda. the platform produced hillary clinton party this year also calls for ""price carbon."" that just political-speak for massive new tax coal and shale production tax american consumers. and remember, every energy dollar that isn harvested here america harvested instead foreign country  often foreign countries not very friendly. that not only means are sending our jobs those countries, but means energy being produced foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards. that just one more reason why should pursue the safe and responsible production america vast energy reserves need america-first energy plan. this means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions innovative new exploration technologies. the development the marcellus and utica shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity millions  more jobs, higher wages larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for change, instead out our country. hillary clinton war energy will cost our economy trillion dollars. she has not only declared war the miners but oil and natural gas production  which supports million jobs the united states. access low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the american chemical industry, which supports,000 jobs pennsylvania have just begun nation recognize our economic advantage that made possible shale energy. the shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for american workers and families the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for american steel. but federal restrictions remain major impediment both shale production specifically, and energy production general. currently, less than percent the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development. almost our nation offshore acreage off-limits energy production. our energy policy will make full use our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources. that means will end the war coal will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive interior department stream rule, and conduct top-down review all anti-coal regulations issued the obama administration will eliminate the highly-invasive ""waters the"" rule, and scrap the trillion dollar obama-clinton climate action plan and the clean power plan  these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills double-digits without any measurable improvement climate will refocus the epa its core mission ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all americans believe firmly conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats environmental agenda will guided true specialists conservation, not those with radical political agendas will future conservation prosperity, and great success will future new technology, new innovation, and new solutions will future can achieve together, beginning with victory november 8th will make america wealthy again will make america safe again. and will make america great again.

"thank you wonderful here virginia state where have many great friends and wonderful employees. tremendous polls keep coming brand new rasmussen poll has points nationwide november 8th are going win this state and are going win the white house are going take the big donors, and big business, and big media are going take the rigged system that has shipped america wealth other countries are going replace our failed and corrupt establishment with new government that serves you, your family, and your country economic agenda can summed three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households america will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands our poorest workers and bring thousands new companies our shores will unleash american energy, creating millions new jobs and lowering energy costs. the obama-clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than massive tax the poor will remove those restrictions day one will repeal and replace disastrous obamacare. president obama promised his plan would reduce premiums,500 dollars. instead, they surged,000. our replacement plan includes expanded access healthcare savings accounts, with support for those who need includes allowing americans buy health insurance across state lines all states, creating dynamic and competitive new market  they will competing for your business also going block grant medicaid states can develop innovative solutions make sure citizen poverty ever falls through the cracks. high-risk pools will also help ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need trade are going end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern nafta and the world trade organization. right now, america eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets. our massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class  and shifting money away from workers large corporations who have borders. there reason hedge funds and wall street are giving tens millions opponent. hillary clinton the voice for the global special interests running the voice the forgotten men and women opponent likes say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."" that she has been ""fighting for children."" why then are million american women and children living poverty the brink poverty? why has she provided relief for the millions americans search affordable, reliable quality childcare? you know the old saying, ""watch what, not what say the trump organization, and campaign for president, women occupy some the highest positions have employed thousands women company. women different backgrounds. women many talents. and just last week, joined daughter, ivanka laid out plan for childcare and eldercare. that plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits. families can also deduct the cost childcare from their taxes huge tax cut for the middle class have also talked about improving education plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child america are also going bring down the cost college. universities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments  but then they don spend those funds those endowments their students will work with congress make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin reduce tuition and student debt. this will get the problem the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. our students are drowning and going fix. women also value security. they want commander-chief that will defeat radical islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence our cities campaign across this country hear many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. they are doing their best their communities and for their families provide safe and nurturing environment. but even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge drugs lose thousands our fellow americans every year opioid use will stop the drug inflow from our borders. these drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs. this must change. every change starts with conversation. together will have this conversation. and will make this change. the changes will start immediately. here virginia are going end the war american energy. hillary clinton says she wants put the miners out work. clinton and kaine also want shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. the clinton regulatory agenda will drive electricity prices for virginia families and will cost the. economy over trillion the way, less than week after taking office, tim kaine proposed billion dollar tax hike virginia, including people earning little,000 dollars year are going open all sources american energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity virginia. another major part our agenda safety believe every family america entitled live safety and peace. today, the nation just opened the smithsonian national museum african-american history and culture congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions the african-american community this nation. african-americans have given much this nation and sacrificed much for this nation. many african-americans are succeeding greatly our country, and will make sure their success protected and supported the same time, too many african-americans have been left behind and trapped poverty will fight make sure every single african-american child this country fully included the american dream. that includes the new civil rights issue our time: school choice. democrats have run the inner cities for half century more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty. the jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime rising those suffering say: vote for donald trump. what you have lose will fix will fight harder for you than anyone has before. the policies hillary clinton have brought only suffering our inner cities  just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went course, she got rich through all  the clintons made another million gross income while she was secretary state. worst all, she put her public office for sale  and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones try cover her tracks following congressional subpoena. there reason the hedge fund managers are donating hillary clinton campaign  and not mine. everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing change, are throwing their money hillary clinton campaign powered own money, and small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens our donors are small dollar donations. every dollar helps deliver your country back you. our campaign about breaking the special interest monopoly washington trying disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. they all part the same political establishment. they the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. they all support the same

"this such amazing city called ""home the heroes,"" because your proud tradition military service. pueblo home four medal honor recipients president eisenhower said, there must ""something the water out there pueblo"" because ""all you guys turn out heroes."" colorado home six military bases are going eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military. another great colorado legacy hunting and fishing are going conserve your land for future generations, and are going save the 2nd amendment. one other issue such great importance colorado energy. hillary clinton wants shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas are going end the war american energy, and are going put the miners back work have also made center piece economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since ronald reagan and the largest regulatory reform american history. that because know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people this country are central issue would like address today our broken tax code issue concern all americans. along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code one the main reasons running for president been saying from the beginning this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system. this not the fault the irs, but the political class that owned outright the special interests and lobbyists these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing already over-complicated set laws  all the behest their favored donors and special interests thousands pages long, and almost one understands. the average american would need army accountants and lawyers wade their way through. many-called experts, due the sheer size and complexity the code, don have clue what these pages represent. the unfairness the tax laws unbelievable something been talking about for long time  despite being beneficiary understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which why the one who can fix them  and that what commit doing businessman and real estate developer have legally used the tax laws benefit, and the benefit company and employees have often said the campaign trail, that have fiduciary responsibility pay more tax than legally required, put another way pay little tax legally possible major real estate developer this country, and throughout the world face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes job minimize the overall tax burden the greatest extent possible  which allows reinvest neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth their communities  and always help our great providers jobs, the small business. the news media now obsessed with alleged tax filing from the 1990 the end one the most brutal economic downturns our country history. the conditions facing real estate developers the early nineties were almost bad the great depression 1929 and far worse than the great recession 2008. what had been booming economy the era ronald reagan changed dramatically  and the business landscape changed with: bank failures, the collapse the savings & loan industry, and the implosion the retail market, and real estate general. many business people, including many competitors, were not able survive. companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost  and lives were destroyed tens thousands people were put out work. some the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt. yet today company bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before. that did not happen chance luck happened action, and talent was able use the tax laws this country, and business acumen dig out this real estate depression when few others did those most difficult times, when many had their backs the wall reached within myself and delivered for company employees family and the communities where properties existed. those who spend their entire lives within the confines government work, and who know virtually nothing business, fail understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit takes for company climb out economic depression the scale had the early nineties. people like opponent hillary clinton, whose only method making money selling government favors and granting access special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. hillary clinton has never created single job her entire life added single dollar value the american economy. hillary clinton hasn made honest dollar her entire life  all she does take from you, from our country, and peddles influence donors, special interests, and foreign actors  for astronomical dollars and like never before corruption the highest order. while made money highly-successful private businessman following the law, hillary clinton made her money corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office for sale her own account, hillary clinton left the white house dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars  without building company creating single thing value. during the early nineties companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that said donald trump could never make back. they said had billions dollars borrowing, and hundreds millions personal guarantees, and pathway out. but never had any doubts and never gave. that because knew heart that when the chips are down when perform very best. and when people make the mistake underestimating, that when they are for their biggest surprise. just look what happened the primary. just look what our incredible movement doing right now. the reason never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that knew myself knew business knew the financial system knew the tax code and, most importantly knew how fight. that what fighter, and now going fight for you. with knowledge knew that would make comeback business. that why here today. that why have left private business for public life  because understand our country very bad shape. and now our country need major comeback needs one now more than ever owe trillion dollars debt, but that only part the story have over $100 trillion dollars unfunded liabilities, and have budget that out control with annual deficits addition, because the incompetence our leaders run massive trade deficits annual basis, now almost $800 billion year. our country broke have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime depleted military open border, and economy that can create full-time high-paying jobs are divided nation, and each week seems are getting more and more divided, with race riots our streets monthly basis. this not the america that was handed down, and not the america want for our children. and certainly not the america want pass down our grandchildren. but this the america will have don turn things around  starting today. what say not lost the american people, because you believe our country headed the wrong direction cannot have another years barack obama, and hillary clinton will worse can turn this all around  but not don make change leadership right now. the failed political establishment must must for the sake your country, your future, and those you love the most the early, they splashed the front pages with stories about how was finished. everybody said that was done  there were front page articles the wall street journal and new york times. they were thrilled and delighted write these negative stories they said was finished. the only person who didn think that was trouble was donald trump started company with small loan and grew borrowed money grow the company. when the bottom fell out the real estate market had all the debt stayed the same  but the value the assets plummeted. but knew how use the tax code rebuild company when others did not understanding the tax code gave big advantage over those who didn have clue, including many competitors who lost everything they had, never heard from again. now, they gone, and here and ready turn things around for this country. the early was very tough time for the world, but tough times you need tough people. these are tough times for america today, and need tough leaders. not people who tell you what you want hear, but people who tell you what you need hear must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the clintons, ever back into the white house again. these tough times were when performed very best. the economy and banks collapsing, the government was mess  but enjoyed waking every day battle enjoyed getting every morning take the financial establishment behalf company and win. that the thinking need for our country  that the thinking need when are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals behalf the american people. put into the boardroom your representative, and will deliver for you. hillary clinton only for herself and her donors here fighting for america. many people have said that perform better under pressure than anyone they ever seen proven that over and over again. that what. when the pressure, when the odds are stacked against, when people say can done  that when just getting started. the thing that motivates the most when people tell something impossible. for, impossible just starting point. from the depths that terrible real estate depression created company worth billions and billions dollars and created tens thousands jobs. our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands workers november 8th, america comeback begins  and are going rise from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before. the people here pueblo know what takes rebuild this country. this city with rich immigrant history, and rich latino history, that has contributed much this country and this state. though the people pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions the world, you are united this one thing: you are all americans. and americans, you are entitled the same protections every other american. everyone lawfully living inside our borders are entitled the same things: safe communities great education, and access high-paying jobs. this the change will deliver. hillary clinton has been there for years and delivered nothing but failure. her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty home. she brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially african-american and hispanic citizens. she opposes school choice, and wants trap poor african-american and hispanic children failing government schools are going get poor minority children out failing schools and into the public, private, charter magnet school their choice. hillary clinton supports obamacare, and wants expand  obamacare absolute disaster. premiums colorado are set another percent  the only way stop this disaster vote trump. hillary clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like bill clinton nafta and china entry into the world trade organization  and next she wants the trans-pacific partnership, the deal she calls the ""gold standard."" colorado has lost more than manufacturing jobs since the nafta and china deals. but while you lost out, hillary clinton has raked cash from her contributors. she and bill have made $150 million speeches special interests. they gave speeches big banks, including million speaking fees from goldman sachs. the clintons received another million from swiss bank after hillary negotiated favorable settlement for them secretary state hide her corruption, hillary clinton put her emails illegal secret server open foreign hacking. then she deleted and bleached,000 emails  after congressional subpoena hide them from the public. she lies congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals worse than watergate. the investigation hillary clinton was rigged, and shame, and one the saddest things that have ever taken place our nation have become banana republic. now, today learned, that the fbi made side deal with clinton top aides destroy their laptops. let repeat that: the fbi reportedly made deal destroy the laptops government officials implicated massive criminal cover. hillary clinton the ringleader criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government the highest levels, and the american people have one chance stop showing and voting november 8th. people have had with the years, the decades clinton corruption. this the year the american people say: enough enough. the clintons are the sordid past are the bright future. now, another issue want address today immigration mentioned, pueblo filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants these hardworking immigrants who stand lose the most from our open borders immigration policy. illegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from hispanic workers living here lawfully today. illegal immigration also brings with massive crime, and massive drugs  including terrible heroin problem right here colorado are going build border wall, and are going stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into colorado are going shut down the sanctuary cities that have led the preventable deaths many. cases like kate steinle, murdered san francisco-time deported illegal immigrant cases like sarah root, killed illegal immigrant released the border president obama  and then released again after the killing. there are over million criminal aliens this county, and are going get them out  and are going get them out quickly the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers have simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign crime will soon come crashing end also have keep our country safe from terrorism. the terrorists who planted the bombs new york and jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country was the mall shooter washington look cases like the boston bombers, here asylum the san bernardino shooter, here fiancé visa from saudi arabia the orlando shooter, the son taliban supporter from afghanistan. terrorists are infiltrating our country. now, hillary clinton wants 550% increase syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the middle east want keep you and your family safe job not represent foreign countries job represent the citizens the united states america  putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first you are living the united states today lawful resident. citizen will ensure you have safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system. immigration security national security. here are some more

"thank you thrilled back arizona days are going win this state and are going win the white house going make america rich again going end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow refugees, keep jobs from pouring out our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations our workers and our small businesses economic agenda very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs want send our best wishes the great governor mike pence prepares for his debate tonight. the debate will contrast between our campaign big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty clinton campaign that stuck the past are change  she four more years obama. clinton can talk about the real problems facing our country because she the one who helped create all our problems the first place hide her corruption, she deleted,000 emails after congressional subpoena. hillary clinton has been there for years, and hasn fixed anything fact, she just made things worse  she failed upstate new york, promising create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing down almost percent. she failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. and she failed latinos and african-americans, producing only more poverty the inner cities. now, after years failure, she complains about how used the tax laws benefit. then why didn she ever try change those laws could not have used them the way did? she could have changed those laws when she was the senate. the reason that she did not that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same did know all their names, and know who they are, but not make them public figures. two public hillary supporters who are known are george soros, who declared losses billion just six months, and warren buffet who 2014, declared losses $873 million know how the tax code works better than anyone, and going fix fair, and just, and works for you and your family made money highly-successful private businessperson following the law. hillary clinton made her money corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office. the problems face country are immense, and going take bold action turn things around. right now owe trillion debt doubled under president obama. our infrastructure like that third-world country. the homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase years. our border wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country. thousands refugees are being admitted, with way screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even our own veterans die waiting for the medical care they need. our annual trade deficit with the world nearly $800 billion year. the federal budget disaster. our state department, mostly under the watch hillary clinton, misplaced lost billion taxpayer funds have the worst-called recovery since the great depression are nation divided, with race riots the streets. our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only discover they can find jobs certainly not the jobs they want. overseas, our failed leaders have empowered iran, unleashed isis, and turned iraq, libya and syria into absolute chaos. our allies aren paying their fair share, foreign countries like russia and china not respect, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even their own cities can provide the most basic services. america needs turnaround. america needs comeback. america needs change. that why running. first are going repeal and replace obamacare. the architect obamacare, jonathan gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was lie called the ""stupidity the american voter."" but the only stupidity was the stupidity our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections the american people you remember all the lies? president obama said you like your doctor you can keep your doctor promised his plan would reduce premiums,500 dollars. instead, they surged,000. now all people, president bill clinton has come out and told the truth about obamacare has absolutely trashed president obama signature legislation. remember, hillary clinton called obamacare ""one the greatest accomplishments president obama the democratic party our country."" bill has different view. here what bill said just said ""crazy system,"" where people end with ""premiums doubled and coverage cut half said the craziest thing the world."" bill clinton said: ""people out there are busting, sometimes hours week, and wind with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut half the people getting killed this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just bit too much money get any these subsidies."" clinton added that ""doesn make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn work couldn agree more. which why first day office going ask republican congress send bill immediately repeal and replace obamacare. this essential for arizona. because obamacare, most the state will only have carrier next year, and premiums are expected% next year. there only way stop vote for trump. early ballots are mailed out october 12th, and you need mail them back early you possibly can. next are going unleash american energy just met with energy producers colorado, and they are pleading with the government let them create jobs and wealth the united states part our plan reach% growth and create least million new jobs are going lift the restrictions shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms job-producing american energy. fixing our trade deals will the foundation our economic revival china, japan, and europe are printing huge sums money  the devaluation currencies staggering what represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens not level playing field, and our politicians don understand what going. our jobs are being lost massive numbers, and are not making things america anymore. too much being made other countries. when president will start making things america again. companies like apple, will start making their computers and iphones our country. our nation has lost one-third its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton nafta deal supported hillary clinton. hillary korea deal also cost another 100,000 jobs. since china entered the world trade organization  another bill and hillary-backed deal,000 factories have shut down left the united states. that factories closing day average. never history has country surrendered much its wealth foreign countries the factories leave, our money leaves with them. stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality life declines rebuilt other countries the expense our own. companies like carrier, general electric, motorola, mattel, fiat chrysler, and many others are moving their jobs mexico, and other countries. and now, ford has announced moving all its small car production mexico also are going renegotiate nafta and don get the deal want will withdraw from nafta and start over get much better deal for our workers are also going stand foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs countries that cheat. jobs will leave from other countries and come into the united states. factories will come rushing, our schools and communities will revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope. but rich nation must also secure nation. security begins the border nation that doesn control borders not nation country that doesn protect its people isn country government that doesn put its own citizens first government unworthy and unfit lead. here are some heartbreaking examples how our government has failed our citizens. countless americans who have died recent years would alive today not for the open border policies this administration. this includes incredible americans like-year-old sarah root. the man who killed her arrived the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into. community under the policies this white house was released again after the crime, and now large. sarah had graduated from college with, top her class, the day before. also among the victims the obama-clinton open borders policies was grant ronnebeck year-old convenience store clerk mesa, arizona was murdered illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted burglary who had also been released from federal custody. another victim kate steinle, gunned down the sanctuary city san francisco illegal immigrant deported five previous times. then there the case year-old earl olander, who was brutally beaten and left bleed death his home. the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the obama administration priorities for removal california-yeard old air force veteran, marilyn pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten death with hammer. her killer had been arrested multiple occasions, but was never deported. also california good friend, jamiel shaw, lost his amazing son the age was viciously shot and killed illegal immigrant with three gun charges well battery police officer  but

around,000 homicide arrests their names. there are more than million criminal aliens the county right now  when president are getting them out, and quickly top that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion year. for the money are going spend illegal immigration over the next ten years could provide one million-risk students with school voucher the same time, our country being infiltrated terrorists. just yesterday immigrant from bangladesh was charged another isis plot. hundreds immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated terrorism inside the united states since. the terrorists who planted the bombs new york and jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country was the mall shooter washington look cases like the boston bombers, here asylum the san bernardino shooter, here fiancé visa from saudi arabia the orlando shooter, the son taliban supporter from afghanistan going keep the terrorists out

bleached and destroyed,000 emails  after congressional subpoena. she lied congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals worse than watergate. the investigation hillary clinton was rigged, and shame, and one the saddest things that have ever taken place our nation have become banana republic. yesterday learned that the fbi made side deal with clinton top aides destroy their laptops. hillary clinton the ringleader criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government the highest levels, and the american people have one chance stop sending your ballots are also going fix our inner cities african-american children under the age six live poverty african-american youth don have jobs. more than,000 have been shot chicago since the beginning the year. homicides are nearly washington. and more than baltimore. the democrats, like hillary clinton, have run the inner cities for years, six years, seventy years more. they produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. they horribly failed and abused our african-american and latino communities those african-americans and latinos suffering our country say: what you have

media corporations that fund, exists for only one reason protect and enrich itself. the establishment has trillions dollars stake this election example, just one single trade deal they like pass, involves trillions dollars controlled many countries, corporations and lobbyists. for those who control the levers power washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents existential threat. this not simply another-year election. this crossroads the history our civilization that will determine whether not the people reclaim control over our government. the political establishment that trying everything stop the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. the political establishment has brought about the destruction our factories and our jobs they flee mexico, china and other countries throughout the world. our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product gdp barely above one percent. workers the united states, were making less than they were almost years ago  and yet they are working harder global power structure that responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country its wealth, and put that money into the pockets handful large corporations and political entities. just look what this corrupt establishment has done our cities like detroit and flint, michigan  and rural towns pennsylvania, ohio, north carolina and across our country. they have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs. the clinton machine the center this power structure seen this firsthand the wikileaks documents which hillary clinton meets secret with international banks plot the destruction. sovereignty order enrich these global financial powers. and, likewise, the emails show that the clinton machine closely and irrevocably tied media organizations that she given the questions and answers advance her debates. clinton also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her the new york times. and the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the clinton campaign helping her win the election. with their control over our government stake, with trillions dollars the line, the clinton machine determined achieve the destruction our campaign, which has now become movement the likes which our country has never seen before  and won let them that. the most powerful weapon deployed the clintons the corporate media. let clear one thing: the corporate media our country longer involved journalism. they are political special interest different than any lobbyist other financial entity with agenda. and their agenda elect the clintons any cost any price matter how many lives they destroy. for them war  and for them, nothing out bounds. this struggle for the survival our nation. this election will determine whether are free nation whether have only the illusion democracy but are fact controlled small handful global special interests rigging the system. this not just conspiracy but reality, and you and know. the establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. anyone who challenges their control deemed sexist racist xenophobe and morally deformed. they will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek destroy your career and reputation. and they will lie, lie and lie even more. the clintons are criminals. this well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged massive cover widespread criminal activity the state department and clinton foundation order keep the clintons power. never history have seen such cover this, one that includes the destruction,000 emails phones, laptops, missing boxes evidence, and and. people who are capable such crimes against our nation are capable anything. and now address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown the clinton machine, the new york times, and other media outlets part concerted, coordinated and vicious attack not coincidence that these attacks come the exact same moment, and all together the same time the wikileaks documents expose the massive international corruption the clinton machine  including,000 more emails this morning these claims about inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the clinton machine knows all fabricated pure fiction and outright lies. these events never happened. the claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic already have substantial evidence dispute these lies, and will made public the appropriate way and the appropriate time. these lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. the media outlets did not even attempt confirm the most basic facts, because even simple investigation would have shown these are false smears. what happening different than what happened other innocent people, like the story written rolling stone magazine  and that magazine should put out business. six months ago, the new york times wrote massive story attacking, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. she said was great guy, and never made those remarks demanded retraction, but they refused print  just like they refused print the comments from another source who praised her book the words another wonderful woman who said nice things. that story was fraud and embarrassment the new york times will part the lawsuit are preparing against them. now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place airplane more than years ago  another ridiculous tale witnesses nothing. also writer from people magazine who wrote story melania and myself our first anniversary. the story was lovely but last night hear, after years new claim that made inappropriate advances ask very simple question, why wasn part the story that appeared years ago was one the biggest stars television, and would have been one the biggest stories the year. take look her words would have been the headline only appears days before the election. this invented account has already been debunked eyewitness testimony  the very witness identified the author has said the story entirely false. this weekend, the new york times published full-page hit piece with another claim from individual who has been totally discredited based the emails and letters she has sent our office over the years. but the new york times refused use the evidence presented them. others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence provided, refused print. this part concerted effort, led the new york times, which fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won even around few years based its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile will not allow the clinton machine turn this campaign into discussion their slanders and lies, but will remain focused the issues facing the american people. but let state this clearly can. these attacks are orchestrated the clintons and their media allies. they are false and slanderous every respect are now less than month from the most important election our lifetime  indeed one the most important elections modern history  and the polls show dead heat. and the new rasmussen poll shows points ahead now, the clinton machine, has put forward small handful people out the tens thousands have met, worked with and employed order make wild and false allegations that fail meet even the most basic test common sense. again, this nothing more than attempt destroy our movement and for the clintons keep their corrupt control over this government. when declared candidacy knew what bad shape our country was had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics knew they would throw every lie they could, and family, and loved ones knew they would stop nothing try stop. but take all these slings and arrows for you take them for our movement that can have our country back. our great civilization, here america and across the civilized world, has come upon moment reckoning seen the united kingdom, where they voted liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty. but the central base world political power here america, and our corrupt political establishment that the greatest power behind the efforts radical globalization and the disenfranchisement working people. their financial resources are unlimited. their political resources are unlimited. their media resources are unlimited. and, most importantly, the depths their immorality unlimited. our political establishment has soul knew these false attacks would come knew this day would arrive. and knew the american people would rise above and vote for the future they deserve. the only thing that can stop the corrupt clinton machine you. the only force strong enough save this country you. the only people brave enough vote out this corrupt establishment you, the american people. they control the department justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the attorney general the united states the back her airplane, while the runway  for minutes most likely discuss her reappointment clinton administration just prior the attorney general making decision over whether not prosecute hillary clinton. likewise, they have corrupted the director the fbi the point which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the fbi are embarrassed and ashamed what done one our great institutions. hillary clinton guilty all the things that director comey stated his press conference and congressional hearings, and far more  and yet let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less. this conspiracy against you, the american people. this our moment reckoning society and civilization didn need this built great company, and had wonderful life could have enjoyed the benefits years successful business for myself and family, instead going through this absolute horror show lies, deceptions and malicious attacks doing because this country has given much, and feel strongly was turn give back. some people warned this campaign would journey hell. but they are wrong will journey heaven because will help many people former life was insider much anybody else  and know what like insider. now being punished for leaving their special club and revealing you their great scam. because used part the club the only one who can fix doing this for the people, and this movement just right  and will take back this country for you and make america great again. the corrupt establishment knows that are existential threat their criminal enterprise. they know, that win, their power gone and returned you. the clouds hanging over our government can lifted, and replaced with bright future  but all depends whether let the new york times decide our future whether let the american people decide our future this clinton campaign destruction allowed work, then other highly successful person  which what our country needs  will ever again run for this office will not lie you. these false attacks hurt lied about slandered smeared publicly and before your family painful. what the clinton machine doing, and family egregious beyond words reprehensible beyond description. but also know not about about all you about all, together country about the veterans who need medical care, the mothers who lost children terrorism and crime about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help about the millions jobless americans. this election about the people being crushed obamacare, and about defeating isis and appointing supreme court justices who will defend our constitution. this election also about the african-american and hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools the policies hillary clinton. they robbed these citizens their future, and will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back will deliver. this election about every man, woman and child our country who deserves live safety, prosperity and peace will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters will vote for the country want will vote for the future want will vote for the politics want will vote put this corrupt government cartel out business will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights nation will end the politics profit will end the rule special interests will put stop the raiding our country  and the disenfranchisement our people. our independence day hand, and arrives,

"thank you days are going win this state and are going win the white house are going deliver real change that puts america first are going renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions american energy, end common core, reduce the cost college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known obamacare. your jobs will come back under trump administration. your incomes will under trump administration. your taxes will way down under trump administration. your companies won leaving our country under trump administration are going rich country again are also going end government corruption. hillary clinton the most corrupt person ever seek the office the presidency  and the media, donors and special interests who support her will everything they can cling their power and prestige your expense. the hillary clinton documents released wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much stake this election. the documents show the clinton campaign colluding with the state department and justice department over the investigation into hillary illegal email server that put your family and your country danger. they show how the clintons ripped off the people haiti. they show the clinton campaign viciously attacking catholics and evangelicals. they also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the clinton campaign cover her crimes, hillary clinton deleted,000 emails  after congressional subpoena  she lied congress under oath, she made phones disappear, some with hammer, and now learn boxes evidence mysteriously went missing. hillary clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone jail for her crimes. the fbi and the department justice created fraud allowing hillary clinton get away with her terrible crimes  and guarantee you, the clintons are laughing them. the director performance congress, coupled with bill clinton clandestine meeting the tarmac the attorney general airplane just prior decision-time hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren perhaps the lowest point those department history. instead being held accountable, hillary running for president what looks like rigged election. the election being rigged corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies effort elect her president. but are going stop are not going back down are not going let happen are just getting started. americans have had with the years, the decades clinton corruption. they get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them other countries. this will finally the year the american people say: enough enough. speaking secret foreign bank hillary clinton said her dream for totally ""open trade and open borders ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat out millions jobs and trillions dollars ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration. when she thought one was listening, hillary clinton was plotting destroy the sovereignty the united states. either win the election lose the country trump administration will secure and defend our borders. and yes will build wall wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth. when won the new hampshire primary promised the people new hampshire that would stop drugs from pouring into your communities now doubling-down that promise, and can guarantee you will not only stop the drugs from pouring, but will help all those people seriously addicted get the assistance they need unchain themselves. new hampshire has one the highest drug overdose death rates the country have solve this crisis have give credit running mate, mike pence this issue. mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction must make similar efforts priority for the nation. not too long ago read about christopher honor and courtney griffin young rockingham county couple who died overdose within year each other. their story prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity the court system are tragic reminder why need plan end the opioid epidemic. first will stop the flow illegal drugs into the country. the number heroin seizures the border has tripled since 2008 received the first-ever endorsement our border patrol and ice officers, and under trump administration will work with them end the flow drugs across our border for good are also going put end sanctuary cities, which refuse turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and will send them swiftly out our country will aggressively prosecute traffickers illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need their jobs. president obama has commuted the sentences record numbers high level drug traffickers, many them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. hillary clinton promises continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals. over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. tens thousands drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless their history violence ties transnational gangs and cartels. second will close the shipping loopholes that china and others are exploiting send dangerous drugs across our borders the hands our own postal service. these traffickers use loopholes the postal service mail fentanyl and other drugs users and dealers the trump administration will crack down this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need accomplish this mission. third will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse tragedy enough that many americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make even harder for them get help. the fda has been far too slow approve abuse-deterring drugs. and when the fda has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number authorized prescribers well the number patients each doctor can treat. recovery medications have the potential save thousands and thousands lives prescribe opioids like oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted those drugs stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need president work lift the cap the number patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision the same time, dea should reduce the amount schedule opioids drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl that can made and sold the have percent the world population, but use percent the prescription opioids. finally will give people struggling with addiction access the help they need. congress has already taken the first step passing the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. this legislation important step would also expand incentives for states and local governments use drug courts and mandated treatment. these can cost effective, appropriate, and humane response addiction would dramatically expand access treatment slots and end medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access narcan antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands lives would also restore accountability our veterans administration. too many our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs that should have been paying them better attention. together, these steps will ensure that every american struggling with addiction has access the care and the help that she needs. but are going bring hope back our communities not only have solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis. the wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams the center our economic revival will fixing our terrible trade deals million americans are poverty and million americans are food stamps have nearly $800 billion annual trade deficit goods with the world, and the worst-called recovery since the great depression. this the legacy obama-clinton. the state new hampshire has lost nearly manufacturing jobs since nafta, signed bill clinton and supported hillary clinton. since china entered the world trade organization  another bill and hillary-backed deal,000 factories have shut down left the united states. that factories closing day average are living through the greatest jobs theft the history the world. companies like carrier, general electric, motorola, mattel, fiat chrysler, and many others are moving their jobs mexico. right here new hampshire visited the osram sylvania plant that closed its doors 2014 and shipped its jobs china and mexico win, day one are going announce our plans renegotiate nafta don get the deal want leave nafta and start over get much better deal are going start making things america again part our plan bring back our jobs are going lower our business tax from percent percent will have% tax money parked overseas, bringing trillions wealth back into our country. manufacturers will able expense the cost new investment and equipment help make our country more competitive will lower taxes massively all americans  hillary will raise your taxes massively will become the great jobs magnet the world. wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores. here are some the amazing things are going for our country starting 2017 are going have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care our vets; repeal and replace obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint justices the supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution the united states. you have days make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true november 8th, the arrogance washington. will come face face with the righteous verdict the american voter going fight for every citizen every background, from every stretch this

will set record lows, believe. that can tell you going create least million new jobs years. and the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. the protesters are paid lot money the dnc. and kept saying wonder why those people are here? because they never seem have much their mind, other than stand and protest. and yesterday came out, but was barely covered the media. but all over the media. they were busted. they were paid,500 each and were given cell phones and disturb trump rallies. and sort always knew chicago, even last night had people stand for reason like, what are they doing here? and can you imagine, that big story, hardly covered the media bad also going create new government that answers the people. hillary clinton—hillary clinton the most corrupt person ever run for the presidency.  she shouldn allowed run for the presidency after what she done tell you true. newly released, two days ago, fbi documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. the undersecretary state, patrick kennedy, illegally pressured the fbi unclassify-mails from hillary clinton illegal server hard believe. and nothing happens her, folks, and nothing ever happens other words, the state department was trying cover hillary crime sending classified information server our enemies could easily access.  the fbi document show that patrick kennedy made the request for altering classification part very, very serious quid pro quo. not allowed. this felony corruption. yesterday said undersecretary kennedy must immediately resign.  the media barely covers this event the way.  this bigger event than watergate and they practically refuse cover. today calling for him fired.  clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family safety and your country safety though meant nothing all her.  remember also that hillary lied under oath congress, saying that she never sent received classified information her secret server. right? she never received that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed have. that you not allowed have. and pretended not know. remember this one: that the letter"" meant confidential information was classified.  she thought was the lettering paragraph.  there never been time our country history where anything like this has gone. and the fbi, there must people there, based what you read, that are ashamed what happened. and the department justice, there must people there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed what been going. hillary then told the fbi she couldn remember times. and then written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn remember another times. bad memory. she got terrible memory.  this elaborate, criminal cover included hillary deleting and bleaching,000-mails. the disappearance iphones, some hammers, two boxes-mail evidence gone missing, that was last week. can you imagine they now missing top everything else, two boxes-mails? and the destruction laptops secret deal with the fbi.  this truly, and said, this truly many times worse than watergate. and going put end november 8th.  going.  another series leaked-mails show top officials the clinton campaign scheming take massive sums money from registered foreign lobbyists. and then you wonder why badly. but you don hear the media talking about that all you? you don see all wikileaks proved, the media merely, and truly just extension the clinton campaign.  the press has created rigged system and poisoned the mind many our voters. they have rigged from the beginning telling totally false stories. most recently about phony allegations where have been under constant attack. they attack business built great business but, although most people admit that. they attacked wonderful family. they attacked temperament. but built incredible company, those papers are filed. and fortunate have beautiful and loving family. you all saw melania last night television. did great job.  that she even has that shame. and temperament has always been just about greatest strength have winning temperament. our country doesn win anymore don win anymore. this election about truth. and you not going get from the dishonest media. some people can handle the truth matter what people may think, the one thing they know that going tell the american people where stand, where are going tell them the truth.  now even though doing pretty good the polls don believe the polls anymore don believe them don believe them. and there, and there one two bad ones, that the only one they show. believe, folks doing great keep our spirit, and out and win, this another brexit, believe. they are worried. that why they become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what going. this rally set just short while ago; look the number people, packed. but every rally the same way her rallies, very few people show, when she has the energy the event. which isn often. she doing debate prep. she did much debate prep. did beat her badly that second debate?  sort funny. she been doing this for years. now she has debate prep for five days. you know what the debate prep resting lying down, going sleep think the media trying discourage our people from going out vote. and was just brought reporter the back. they said, you know very interesting, when you were fighting people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when started take the lead the polls. they said, ""wait minute, this thing going happen going happen."" change stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our second amendment. they saying, this going happen. and true. made stories. they liars and made stories. without the media and all the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would nothing. she would nothing. she really—she would doing badly. even worst critics agree that the media has come after like they have never come after anyone before badge honor mean, you know, what going? even the new york times, which totally dishonest the way—here the good news about the new york times. they won business much longer you see what they losing?  they are dying. they are dying. and they dying also because they very dishonest. but one their biggest columnist-reporters wrote story about how bad said, let face—this the new york times ""balance has been vacation since. trump stepped onto this golden trump tower escalator announce his candidacy."" can you believe that? they admitting. they don even care actually said that don care. they will anything stop what doing. not what doing agenda going agenda change. but won let them stop maybe the greatest movement the history our country. history watching now, waiting see will rise the moment have rise have under tremendous opposition have the greatest people the world. that what learned. somebody said, what the most important thing you learned? how great the american people are gone all over the country have two things learned that, and learned how totally dishonest the media dishonest learned that, too. they are the most dishonest people ever dealt with. not all them, but, honestly, like percent. some are very good, but for the most part, yes have stories that think are going unbelievable stories. they turn out—they make them bad possible have stories the other side that would normally dismantle campaign, and they don even report them disgrace. what going disgrace. but only just begun fight, believe have three weeks. you know what have three weeks. and hear going great colorado people back said, ""you going win colorado, doesn matter what they say.""  get out and vote. but they even want try and rig the election the polling booths where many cities are corrupt. and you see that. and voter fraud all too common. and then they criticize for saying that. and have even republicans, that such terrible thing say."" well, take look philadelphia, what been going. take look chicago, take look. louis. take look some these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. and you talk about them, they say bad things about you. they call you racist. they call you all—and the way, speaking that, nobody will more for the african-american citizens this country than donald trump, nobody, nobody. nobody will more for the latino community than donald trump can tell you 2014, the washington post, another beauty, published article entitled, ""could non-citizens decide the november election?"" the article found that percent non-citizens were registered vote percent were registered vote. and not supposed talk about. and your republican leaders said, this—everything peachy-dory,"" right? and also found non-citizen voting may have given democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed pass obamacare washington policy, not. the system also rigged the donors giving hundreds millions dollars crooked hillary campaign rigged bad system. the reason hillary clinton pushes for nafta the trans-pacific partnership, which will also disaster—nafta the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made anybody the world one-way highway out get the drugs, right get the drugs get the unemployment get the empty factories. mexico and other countries get the cash. they get the employment. they get the plants. and for completely open borders—she wants completely open borders because her international donors control her every move let crooked hillary cartel and—and just remember this—run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that america lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence. and the way, this our final shot, folks four years over. you never going able win. you never going able win tilting going one-party system. this your final shot for the supreme court, for your second amendment mean, this your final shot, november 8th hopefully you what you know you have. get out bed and vote matter how you feeling matter how you feeling indeed time drain the swamp washington. this why proposing package ethics reforms make our government honest once again. first going institute five-year ban all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right? second going ask congress institute its own five-year ban lobbying former members congress and their staffs. that simple one. and they know this should done, but they not going, but they get going, number three, expand the definition lobbyists that close all the loopholes that former government officials use labeling themselves  right been talking about that for years. decades failure washington and decades special interest dealing must and will come end. and remember the time this ends will have spent over $100 million campaign. hillary spent nothing. she gets all her money from the special interest donors. and interest you interest you have break the cycle corruption, and have give new voices change. and have have have choice that can have government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn right now, including giving iran billion cash. booing and remember the deportation 800 people? turned out 800 people, then went,800 people. and they were going deported for good reason. you know our country deports somebody, they got pretty, pretty out there. well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations have,800 new citizens the united states. and when said, ""undo,"" they said that wouldn constitutional. hey, folks, how stupid are being led? the time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. not only will end our government corruption, but will end the economic stagnation that right now growth plan for the economy can summed three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs will happen the center our historic jobs plan will fixing our terrible trade deals, which wanted from the beginning million americans are poverty and million americans are living right now food stamps hard believe this our country have nearly $800 billion annual trade deficit goods with the world. and the worst-called recovery since the great depression you know that? the worst since the great depression. colorado has lost one seven manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta, and deal supported hillary clinton very strongly. and this thought was typographical error, because figured they meant 700,000, but wasn lost,000 factories since china entry into the world trade organization. another bill and hillary backed disaster are living through the greatest job theft the history the world. more jobs have been stolen from our country stupidly let them let our companies foolishly don know what doing trump administration going renegotiate nafta, stand the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back the other direction part our plan bring back our jobs going lower our business tax from percent percent are right now the highest-taxed nation the world. that one the reasons our companies are leaving also going fix our inner cities percent african-american children, under the age six are living poverty percent african-american youth are not working. almost,500 people have been shot the city chicago. can you believe this? since january 1st. the national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase more than years. can you believe that? murder, highest rate years you don—they don seem. she said, ""nobody cares."" and you right, they don seem too those african-americans suffering those latinos suffering say: what you have lose? elect donald trump will fix will fix will fix going get very big african-american vote going get very big latino vote. because the democrats come, they want your vote. and soon you give them the vote, they say, ""see you four years."" they don anything gotten worse and worse for both the african-americans, the latino-hispanics gotten worse and will only get worse. they want your vote. hillary clinton said she was going fix the state new york when she ran for the senate total disaster will rich nation once again. but rich country must also safe country.  our national security begins the border. speaking secret foreign bank promise will build the wall.  hillary clinton said her dream for total open trade. there your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country. simple that. there are already record million people the united states who speak language other than english their interest and everyone interest control immigration

"thank you.  thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. thank you please sit down. thank you privilege here gettysburg hallowed ground where many lives were given service freedom. amazing place. president lincoln served time division like never seen before hope that can look his example heal the divisions are living through right now are very divided nation not politician and have never wanted politician, believe. but, when saw the trouble our country was knew couldn stand and watch any longer. our country has been good love our country and felt had act seen the system-close-and-personal for many years been major part know how the game works washington and wall street and know how they rigged the rules the game against everyday americans. the rules are rigged. nearly one four americans their prime earning years isn even working. one five households have one with job million americans are food stamps and million are living poverty have failed our inner cities and doing have failed our african-american and hispanic communities misguided military adventures overseas and wars that forever that just cannot won the people that are doing now. they don know how win the wars home have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care. change has come from outside our very broken system. our system broken. the fact that washington and the washington establishment has tried hard stop our campaign only more proof that our campaign represents the kind change that only arrives once-lifetime.  the system totally rigged and broken. first, the issue voter fraud. according pew, there are million voter registrations the united states that are either invalid significantly significantly inaccurate. and when say that there are such inaccuracies unbelievable million dead people are registered vote and some them are voting wonder how that happens million people are registered more than one state number folks. these are numbers. fourteen percent non-citizens are registered vote. the system also rigged because hillary clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency the united states. but, the fbi and the justice department covered her crimes which included lying the fbi and congress numerous occasions and included saying not recall the fbi separate times. she recalls everything else, but separate times she said not recall. well, that lies. also, then there the deletion least,000 emails after receiving subpoena from the united states congress that after receiving the subpoena example was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general james cartwright, maybe sentenced five years prison with massive fine for lying one occasion the fbi said did that for national security reasons. highly respected man four-star general. this took place two days ago. how must feel big part the rigging this election the fact that hillary being allowed run despite having broken many laws many different occasions. why she allowed run? the dishonest, mainstream media also part major part this corruption. they corrupt. they lie and fabricate stories make candidate that not their preferred choice, look bad and even dangerous possible rallies, they never show talk about the massive crowd size and try diminish all our events the other hand, they don show the small size hillary crowds but fact talk about how many people are there. very small crowds. you know. they know. over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said first place and one those pollsters was the most accurate pole the last two cycles. but, the media refuses even say put that word out. they refused talk about. they trying desperately suppress vote and the voice the american people example the power structure and fighting buying time warner and the cnn deal will not approve administration because too much concentration power the hands too few. likewise, amazon, which through its ownership controls the washington post, should paying massive taxes not paying and very unfair playing field and you see what that happening and what that doing department stores all over the country. very very unfair and you talking about billions and billions dollars. they should paying those taxes. additionally, comcast purchase nbc concentrates far too much power one massive entity that trying tell the voters what think and what. deals like this destroy democracy and look breaking that deal and other deals like that. this should never ever have been approved the first place. they trying poison the mind the american voter. every woman lied when they came forward hurt campaign. total fabrication. the events never happened, never. all these liars will sued after the election over but simple phone called placed the biggest newspapers television networks get them wall-wall coverage with virtually fact-checking whatsoever. here why this relevant you they can fight somebody like who has unlimited resources fight back, just look what they can you. your jobs. your security. your education. your healthcare. the violation religious liberty. the theft your second amendment. the loss your factories, your homes, and much more. look what they done you with your jobs just been lined video, that the violent protests some rallies, like chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. you saw that blood pouring down their face were caused paid, paid dnc and clinton campaign operatives. now didn know this didn know, this just came out two days ago tape didn know this were amazed the level violence. these were paid operatives. paid the dnc and probably the clinton campaign. this criminal act. policemen were badly hurt and were many others and these people prosecuted. but because the rigged system they probably won. just like found out about these paid violent protesters was probably the dnc and the clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. but find out their involvement later date through litigation and look forward doing. the rigging the system designed for one reason keep the corrupt establishment and special interests power your expense and everybody expense have special interest but you the american vogel didn have this, believe. there nothing easy about but had love our country love the people our country and felt had.  thank you. one thing all know that will never solve our problems relying the same politicians who created these problems the first place. hillary clinton not running against, she running against change and she running against all the american people and all the american voters now find ourselves that very special fork the road repeat the mistakes the past choose believe that great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for and for our wonderful beloved country think does know does economic plan will deliver least million jobs one decade. now, our jobs have been taken away. they gone mexico. they gone many other countries one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and get the drugs and get the unemployment and going change. believe going change.  and that goes for all countries. when you look china, when you look every trade deal have horrible and should ashamed people and the people that let those deals happen. they defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for reason. and believe they will unwound fast and will have trade will have great trade and free trade but fair trade and real security plan important. they taken the jobs from security plan will bring safety our poorest communities ethics plan will end corruption our government will. corruption massive will drain the swamp washington and replace with new government, and for the people.  that why have chosen gettysburg unveil this contract asking the american people rise above the noise and the clutter our broken politics and embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient the american character and there nothing better stronger than the american character asking the american

""hispanics for trump.""  there one ""women and hispanics for trump.""  thank you very much six days are going win the great state florida and are going win back the white house 100 percent the cusp incredible historic change that transfers power from failed political establishment and returns that power our families, communities and citizens you. the system rigged, remember that. the system rigged. right now rigged going change. there some breaking news about that subject that going discuss right now mentioned yesterday the—and you probably saw this and maybe some you have just read.one the top department justice officials involved the-mail investigation, assistant attorney general peter kassig booing close associate john podesta. the two met for dinner after clinton testified about benghazi and podesta, who the way said hillary clinton has terrible instincts wikileaks, described him the man who kept him, podesta, out jail. kadzik also the one who helped lead the effort confirm attorney general loretta lynch. now, today newly released- mail—through wikileaks again learned that kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the clinton campaign and that booing right? and that kadzik said quote will while before the state department posts the-mails."" remember they were waiting for the-mails. booing podesta forwarded the-mails clinton top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. these are the people that want run our country, folks. booing the spread political agendas into the justice department—there never been thing like this that has happened our country history one the saddest things that has happened our country. but with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice, show early and vote. show early. you know, the lines are incredible. the polls are all saying going win florida. don believe. don believe. get out there and vote. pretend slightly behind. you got get don want blow this. this the one chance have never happen again not going happen four years not going happen can happen again. this movement like have never seen this country before. these crowds, the enthusiasm, the love.  got get out and vote. real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare.  and hillary not going the answer because she wants make more expensive. she doubling down just been announced that the residents florida—sorry tell you this, folks—are going experience massive, massive double digit premium hike. booing now know what that hike, but want you leave here happy want you happy people want you think about the future after take back the white house not going tell you what your hike, but let just say going very substantial. and obamacare doesn work top everything else example the great state arizona—which just left—premiums are going more than 116 percent out control. over percent the counties florida are losing obamacare insurance next year. lots luck your negotiation minnesota where the premium increase will close percent, the democratic governor said, the affordable care act longer affordable. premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. wasn supposed like this, but said was going like this before was passed because understand how business works. obamacare never had chance catastrophe. yet hillary clinton wants double down obamacare making even more expensive going lot. people aren going able afford not sure that matters, they just not going able pay asking for your vote can replace obamacare and save health care for every family florida and the united states.  real change also means restoring honesty our government you know, the fbi has—did you hear about this little event? the fbi-opening the investigation.  they-opening the investigation into crooked hillary clinton. booing crooked hillary, she crooked. booing lock her! lock her! lock her! she crooked one, there question. crooked hillary clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone calling her—has anyone seen crooked hillary clinton today?  that going great term for president, right? boy boy, what mess. this the biggest scandal since watergate. and now been reported that there are fbi inquiries probing virtually all hillary clinton inner circle and many the things she done over the years about time. remember rigged system, remember about time. she wants blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has one blame but herself. hillary the one who set the illegal private-mail server shield her criminal activity. the woman screaming exactly, exactly exactly. hillary the one who engaged corrupt pay-for-play scheme the state department and who ripped off the people haiti, the people haiti were ripped off. booing and met with the people little haiti. anybody here? these are great people, great, thank you. hillary the one who endangered national security sending classified information insecure server. hillary the one who lied many times congress and the fbi. hillary the one who made phones disappear, some with hammer. booing and she the one who destroyed,000-mails after receiving congressional subpoena. booing she also accepted debate questions given her advance donna brazile booing and then used those debate questions cheat cheating, the worst level. instead reporting this breach ethics committee whoever would listen the breach she got the answers, cheating. she got the questions, cheating. and then she—rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn happening—she used them against bernie sanders. can you imagine. she probably got them against too except won the debate easy don think mattered won those debates.  did you see her the end the debates? folks, she was exhausted. you know what she did? she immediately went home and went sleep.  hillary not the victim, and the american people, frankly, are the victims this rigged and corrupt system every way. but this your chance finally change, november 8th. now florida case, earlier. now, just you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable doing great with the african-american community doing great with the hispanic community.  and the lines are four, five and six blocks long. they never seen anything like. and the polls have just come way florida shouldn say that, because want you vote, ready going pretend down down. pretend, right pretend down got win got win big got beat her. got beat her ohio iowa north carolina think doing great pennsylvania; from what hear.  folks, you going proud. you going proud going make america great again. you going happy and you going proud your country again hillary clinton were elected would create unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. booing haven just been through lot with the clintons, right? remember when was impeached for lying can practice law doesn have the right practice law. didn just through this? and the last thing need another four years obama. that the last thing. booing and this will worse. that means isis, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means border. without border don have country. the work government would grind halt she were ever elected. she court for her entire tenure and she convicted. because look, the first time mean, frankly, forget about this time. the first time she gets subpoena from the united states congress and she deletes everything? there shouldn have been second time. but have respect that the fbi has given second chance. and this time have doubt that that 650,000-mails—did you see where they said not worried. they duplicates. how can there duplicates there are hundreds thousands more than you started off with?

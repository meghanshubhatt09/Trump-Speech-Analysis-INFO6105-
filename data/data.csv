"thank opportunity speak you, thank center national interest honoring invitation would like talk today develop new foreign policy direction country  one replaces randomness purpose, ideology strategy, chaos peace time shake rust america foreign policy time invite new voices new visions fold. the direction outline today also return timeless principle foreign policy always put interests american people, american security, else. that foundation every decision make. america first major overriding theme administration. but chart path forward, must first briefly look back lot proud 1940s saved world. the greatest generation beat back nazis japanese imperialists. then saved world again, time totalitarian communism. the cold war lasted decades, won. democrats republicans working together got. gorbachev heed words president reagan said: ""tear wall."" history forget did. unfortunately, cold war, foreign policy veered badly course failed develop new vision new time fact, time went, foreign policy began make less less sense. logic replaced foolishness arrogance, led one foreign policy disaster another went mistakes iraq egypt libya, president obama line sand syria. each actions helped throw region chaos, gave isis space needs grow prosper began dangerous idea could make western democracies countries experience interest becoming western democracy tore institutions surprised unleashed. civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands american lives, many trillions dollars, lost result. the vacuum created isis would fill. iran, too, would rush fill void, much unjust enrichment. our foreign policy complete total disaster vision, purpose, direction, strategy. today want identify five main weaknesses foreign policy. first, our resources are overextended president obama weakened military weakening economy crippled wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, huge trade deficit open borders. our manufacturing trade deficit world approaching trillion year rebuilding countries weakening own. ending theft american jobs give resources need rebuild military regain financial independence strength person running presidency understands problem knows fix. secondly, allies paying fair share. our allies must contribute toward financial, political human costs tremendous security burden. but many simply. they look united states weak forgiving feel obligation honor agreements nato, instance member countries, besides america, spending minimum required% gdp defense spent trillions dollars time  planes, missiles, ships, equipment  building military provide strong defense europe asia. the countries defending must pay cost defense  and, not. must prepared let countries defend themselves. the whole world safer allies part support common defense security trump administration lead free world properly armed funded. thirdly, friends beginning think can depend president dislikes friends bows enemies negotiated disastrous deal iran, watched ignore terms, even ink dry. iran cannot allowed nuclear weapon and, trump administration, never allowed nuclear weapon. all without even mentioning humiliation united states iran treatment ten captured sailors negotiation, must willing walk. the iran deal, like many worst agreements, result willing leave table. when side knows going walk, becomes absolutely impossible win time, friends need know stick agreements them. president obama gutted missile defense program, abandoned missile defense plans poland czech republic supported ouster friendly regime egypt longstanding peace treaty israel  helped bring muslim brotherhood power place. israel, great friend one true democracy middle east, snubbed criticized administration lacks moral clarity. just days ago, vice president biden criticized israel  force justice peace  acting impediment peace region. president obama friend israel treated iran tender love care made great power middle east  expense israel, allies region and, critically, united states picked fights oldest friends, they starting look elsewhere help. fourth, rivals longer respect fact, confused allies, even bigger problem take seriously more. when president obama landed cuba air force one, leader meet greet  perhaps incident without precedent long prestigious history air force one. then, amazingly, thing happened saudi arabia -- called respect remember president made long expensive trip copenhagen, denmark get olympics country, and, unprecedented effort, announced united states came fourth place known result making embarrassing commitment. the list humiliations goes. president obama watches helplessly north korea increases aggression expands even nuclear reach. our president allowed china continue economic assault american jobs wealth, refusing enforce trade rules  apply leverage china necessary rein north korea even allowed china steal government secrets cyber attacks engage industrial espionage united states companies let rivals challengers think get away anything president obama goal weaken america, could done better job. finally, america longer clear understanding foreign policy goals. since end cold war break soviet union lacked coherent foreign policy. one day bombing libya getting rid dictator foster democracy civilians, next day watching civilians suffer country falls apart humanitarian nation. but legacy obama-clinton interventions weakness, confusion, disarray made middle east unstable chaotic ever before left christians subject intense persecution even genocide. our actions iraq, libya syria helped unleash isis. and war radical islam, president obama even name enemy! hillary clinton also refuses say words ""radical islam,"" even pushes massive increase refugees. after secretary clinton failed intervention libya, islamic terrorists benghazi took consulate killed ambassador three brave americans. then, instead taking charge night, hillary clinton decided home sleep! incredible. clinton blames video, excuse total lie. our ambassador murdered secretary state misled nation  way, awake take call'clock morning. and isis making millions dollars week selling libyan oil. this change president friends allies say america going strong again. america going reliable friend ally again going finally coherent foreign policy based upon american interests, shared interests allies getting nation-building business, instead focusing creating stability world. our moments greatest strength came politics ended water edge need new, rational american foreign policy, informed best minds supported parties, well close allies. this cold war, win new future struggles. first, need long-term plan halt spread reach radical islam. containing spread radical islam must major foreign policy goal united states. events may require use military force. but also philosophical struggle, like long struggle cold war going working closely allies muslim world, risk radical islamic violence work together nation region threatened rise radical islam. but two-way street  must also good remember them. the struggle radical islam also takes place homeland. there scores recent migrants inside borders charged terrorism. for every case known public, dozens more must stop importing extremism senseless immigration policies pause reassessment help prevent next san bernardino worse -- look world trade center september 11th. and there isis simple message them. their days numbered tell tell how must, nation, unpredictable. but they going gone. and soon. secondly, rebuild military economy. the russians chinese rapidly expanded military capability, look what happened! our nuclear weapons arsenal  ultimate deterrent  allowed atrophy desperately need modernization renewal. our active duty armed forces shrunk million 1991 million today. the navy shrunk 500 ships 272 ships time. the air force smaller 1991. pilots flying-52s combat missions today older people room. and this? president obama proposed 2017 defense budget that, real dollars, cuts nearly% spending 2011. our military depleted asking generals military leaders worry global warming spend need rebuild military cheapest investment make develop, build purchase best equipment known mankind. our military dominance must unquestioned. but look savings spend money wisely time mounting debt, one dollar wasted also going change trade, immigration economic policies make economy strong  put americans first again. this ensure workers, right america, get jobs higher pay grow tax revenue increase economic might nation need think smarter areas technological superiority gives edge. this includes printing, artificial intelligence cyberwarfare great country also takes care warriors. our commitment absolute trump administration give service men women best equipment support world serve, best care world return veterans civilian life. finally, must develop foreign policy based american interests. businesses succeed lose sight core interests neither countries. look happened 1990s. our embassies kenya tanzania attacked seventeen brave sailors killed uss cole. and seemed put effort adding china world trade organization  disaster united states  stopping qaeda even opportunity take osama bin laden. and then, got hit world trade center pentagon, worst attack country history. our foreign policy goals must based america core national security interests, following priorities middle east, goals must defeat terrorists promote regional stability, radical change need clear-sighted groups never anything enemies. and must generous prove friends desire live peacefully friendship russia china serious differences two nations, must regard open eyes. but bound adversaries seek common ground based shared interests. russia, instance, also seen horror islamic terrorism believe easing tensions improved relations russia  position strength  possible. common sense says cycle hostility must end. some say russians reasonable intend find out can make good deal america, quickly walk table. fixing relations china another important step towards prosperous century. china respects strength, letting take advantage economically, lost respect massive trade deficit china, deficit must find way, quickly, balance strong smart america america find better friend china benefit separate ways. after elected president also call summit nato allies, separate summit asian allies summits, discuss rebalancing financial commitments, take fresh look adopt new strategies tackling common challenges. for instance, discuss upgrade nato outdated mission structure  grown cold war  confront shared challenges, including migration islamic terrorism hesitate deploy military force alternative. but america fights, must fight win never send finest battle unless necessary  plan victory. our goal peace prosperity, war destruction. the best way achieve goals disciplined, deliberate consistent foreign policy. with president obama secretary clinton exact opposite: reckless, rudderless aimless foreign policy  one blazed path destruction wake. after losing thousands lives spending trillions dollars, far worse shape middle east ever before challenge anyone explain strategic foreign policy vision obama-clinton  complete total disaster also prepared deploy america economic resources. financial leverage sanctions persuasive  need use selectively determination. our power used others play rules. our friends enemies must know draw line sand enforce. however, unlike candidates presidency, war aggression first instinct. you cannot foreign policy without diplomacy superpower understands caution restraint signs strength. although government service totally war iraq, saying many years would destabilize middle east. sadly correct, biggest beneficiary iran, systematically taking iraq gaining access rich oil reserves  something wanted decades. and now, top off, isis goal establish foreign policy endure several generations. that also look talented experts new approaches, practical ideas, rather surrounding perfect resumes little brag except responsibility long history failed policies continued losses war. finally work allies reinvigorate western values institutions. instead trying spread ""universal values"" everyone shares, understand strengthening promoting western civilization accomplishments inspire positive reforms around world military interventions. these goals, president seek foreign policy americans, whatever party, support, friends allies respect welcome. the world must know abroad search enemies, always happy old enemies become friends, old friends become allies achieve goals, americans must confidence country leadership again. many americans must wonder politicians seem interested defending borders foreign countries own. americans must know putting american people first again trade, immigration, foreign policy  jobs, incomes security american worker always first priority country ever prospered failed put interests first. both friends enemies put countries, fair them, must same longer surrender country, people, false song globalism. the nation-state remains true foundation happiness harmony skeptical international unions tie bring america down, never enter america agreement reduces ability control affairs. nafta, example, total disaster. emptied states manufacturing jobs. never again. only reverse happen keep jobs bring new ones. their consequences companies leave. exploit later. under trump administration, american citizen ever feel needs come second citizens foreign countries view world clear lens american interests america greatest defender loyal champion apologize becoming successful again, instead embrace unique heritage makes are. the world peaceful, prosperous, america strongest. america continually play role peacemaker always help save lives and, indeed, humanity itself. but play role, must make america strong again must make america respected again. and must make america great again that, perhaps century peaceful prosperous world ever known. thank you.",<FreqDist with 948 samples and 1745

his father published support afghan taliban, regime murders share radical views. the father even said running president country. the bottom line reason killer america first place allowed family come here. that fact, fact need talk about dysfunctional immigration system permit know let country, permit protect citizens incompetent administration elected president, change next four years -- must change, must change now. with fifty people dead, dozens wounded, cannot afford talk around issue anymore -- address head called ban san bernardino, met great scorn anger now, many saying right --

brutally murdered islamic terrorists cold blood. her plan disarm law-abiding americans, abolishing 2nd amendment, leaving bad guys terrorists guns. she wants take away americans' guns, admit people

countries outside middle east. our government admitting ever-growing numbers, year year, without effective plan security fact, clinton state department charge admissions process people applying enter overseas. having learned nothing attacks, plans massively increase admissions without screening plan, including 500% increase syrian refugees. this could better, bigger version legendary trojan horse

become rich again. that mean america first. our country better start making products again, bringing great manufacturing capabilities back shores. our founders understood this. one first major bills signed george washington called ""the encouragement protection manufacturing"" america. our first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned saying: ""the abandonment protective policy american government produce want ruin among people visited cities towns across america seen devastation caused trade policies bill hillary clinton. hillary clinton supported bill clinton disastrous nafta, like supported china entrance world trade organization lost nearly one-third manufacturing jobs since two hillary-backed agreements signed. our trade deficit china soared% hillary clinton time secretary

stevens staff libya made hundreds requests security. hillary clinton state department refused all. she started war put libya, denied security asked for, left die cover tracks, hillary lied video cause

change syria thrown country one bloodiest civil wars anyone ever seen  giving isis launching pad terrorism west. she helped force friendly regime egypt replace radical muslim brotherhood. the egyptian military retaken control, clinton opened pandora box radical islam. then, disastrous strategy announcing departure date iraq, handing large parts country isis killers. isis threatens today decisions hillary clinton made. isis also threatens peaceful muslims across middle east, peaceful muslims across world, terribly victimized horrible brutality  want raise kids peace safety short, hillary clinton tryout presidency produced one deadly foreign policy disaster another started bad judgment supporting war iraq first place. though government service among earliest criticize rush war, yes, even war ever started. but hillary clinton learned nothing iraq, got power, wait rush war libya. she lacks temperament, judgment competence lead words secret service agent posted outside oval office: ""she simply lacks integrity temperament serve office bottom soul know true her leadership style  volcanic, impulsive disdainful rules set everyone else  changed bit."" perhaps terrifying thing hillary clinton foreign policy refuses acknowledge threat posed radical islam fact, hillary clinton supports radical 550% increase syrian refugees coming united states, that increase president

backers communist china  putting america danger. then,000 emails deleted. while may know deleted emails, enemies probably probably blackmail file someone wants president united states. this fact alone disqualifies presidency can hand government someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may hands enemies. national security also immigration security  hillary wants neither. hillary clinton put forward radical immigration platform history united states. she pledged grant mass amnesty first 100 days, end virtually immigration enforcement, thus create totally open borders united states. the first victims radical policies poor african-american hispanic workers need jobs. they ones hurt most. let share letter campaign received mary ann mendoza. she lost amazing son, police sergeant brandon

"thank invitation speak today wonderful detroit begin great national conversation economic renewal america conversation make american great again everyone, especially least. the city detroit where our story begins detroit economic envy world. the people detroit helped power america position global dominance 20th century. when governed america first policy, detroit booming. engineers, builders, laborers, shippers countless others went work day, provided families, lived american dream. but many living city, dream long ago vanished. when abandoned policy america first, started rebuilding countries instead own. the skyscrapers went beijing, many cities around world, factories neighborhoods crumbled detroit. our roads bridges fell disrepair, yet found money resettle millions refugees taxpayer expense. today, detroit per capita income,000 dollars, half national average percent city residents live poverty, two-and-half times national average. the unemployment rate twice national average. half detroit residents work. detroit tops list most dangerous cities terms violent crime—these silenced victims whose stories never told hillary clinton, victims whose suffering less real permanent short, city detroit living, breathing example opponent failed economic agenda. every policy failed city, many others, policy supported hillary clinton. she supports high taxes radical regulation forced jobs community crime policies made less safe immigration policies strained local budgets...and trade deals like nafta, signed husband, shipped jobs mexico countries supports education policies deny students choice, freedom opportunity. she candidate past. ours campaign future. this city controlled democratic politicians every level, unless change policies, change results. today outline economic vision coming weeks, offering detail policies, ones already rolled viewed campaign website. our opposition, hand, long ago run ideas. all hillary clinton offer same: taxes, regulations, bureaucrats, restrictions american energy american production foreign power looking weaken america, better hillary clinton economic agenda. nothing would make foreign adversaries happier country tax regulate companies jobs existence. the one common feature every hillary clinton idea punishes working business united states. every policy tilts playing field towards countries expense. that tries distract tired political rhetoric seeks label, divide, pull apart campaign reaching everyone americans, returning government puts american people first. here america first economic plan looks like. first, let talk tax reform. taxes one biggest differences race. hillary clinton—who spent career voting tax increases—plans another massive job-killing trillion-dollar tax increase. her plan would tax many small businesses almost fifty percent. recently, campaign event, hillary clinton short-circuited again use famous term—when accidentally told truth said wanted raise taxes middle class proposing across-the-board income tax reduction, especially middle-income americans. this lead millions new good-paying jobs. the rich pay fair share, one pay much destroys jobs, undermines ability compete part reform, eliminate carried interest deduction special interest loopholes good wall street investors, people like, unfair american workers. tax simplification major feature plan. our current tax code burdensome complex waste billion hours year tax code compliance plan reduce current number brackets, dramatically streamline process work house republicans plan, using brackets proposed percent. for many american workers, tax rate zero. while develop set assumptions policies, agreeing areas others, focused shared goals guided shared principles: jobs, growth opportunity. these reforms offer biggest tax revolution since reagan tax reform, unleashed years continued economic growth job creation make america grow again days ahead, provide details plan help family present night-and-day contrast job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing obama-clinton agenda. the state new york already lived hillary clinton failed leadership. the washington post published devastating article hillary clinton broken promises. she pledged 200,000 jobs upstate new york senator. but happened? the washington post writes quote: ""upstate job growth stagnated overall tenure, manufacturing jobs plunging nearly percent former first lady unable pass big ticket legislation many promised jobs never materialized others migrated states turned first presidential run data shows upstate actually lost jobs clinton first term."" compare record recent new york post article steve cuozzo, ""how donald trump helped save new york city,"" paper writes—and direct quote—""waded landscape empty fifth avenue storefronts, dust-bowl mugging ground central park wall street area seemingly last legs companies moved almost force rode rescue. expressing rare faith future, instrumental kick-starting regeneration neighborhoods landmarks almost given dead."" this want country want jumpstart america. now let look obama-clinton policies done nationally. their policies produced% growth, weakest-called recovery since great depression, doubling national debt. there million americans outside labor force million president obama took office, increase nearly million people. the obama-clinton agenda tax, spend regulate created silent nation jobless americans. home ownership lowest rate years. nearly million added food stamp rolls since president obama took office. another nearly million americans added ranks poverty lowest labor force participation rates four decades percent african-american youth either outside labor force employed american households single member labor force. these real unemployment numbers—the five percent figure one biggest hoaxes modern politics. meanwhile, american households earning,000 less today sixteen years ago. the average worker today pays percent wages income payroll taxes top that, state local taxes consume another percent. the united states also highest business tax rate among major industrialized nations world percent almost percent add taxes state level words, punish companies making products america—but let ship products. tax-free move overseas. this backwards. all policies geared towards keeping jobs wealth inside united states. under plan, american company pay% business income taxes. small businesses benefit plan. hillary clinton plan require small business pay much three times taxes proposing, onerous regulations put totally business going cut regulations massively. our lower business tax also end job-killing corporate inversions, cause trillions new dollars wealth come pouring country—and cities like detroit help unleash new job creation, allow businesses immediately expense new business investments one gain proposals low-and-middle income americans plan also help reduce cost childcare allowing parents fully deduct average cost childcare spending taxes also going bring back trillions dollars american businesses parked overseas. our plan bring cash home, applying percent tax. this money-invested states like michigan. finally, family pay death tax. american workers paid taxes whole lives, taxed death plain wrong repeal. next comes regulatory reform taxes one overriding goal comes regulation want keep jobs wealth america. motor vehicle manufacturing one heavily regulated industries country. the. economy today twenty-five percent smaller would without surge regulations since 1980 estimated current overregulation costing economy much trillion dollars year—that money taken straight cities like yours. the federal register,000 pages long wall street journal noted, president obama issued close four hundred new major regulations since taking office, cost american economy $100 million more 2015 alone, obama administration unilaterally issued,000 new regulations—each hidden tax american consumers, massive lead weight american economy time remove anchor dragging down. upon taking office issue temporary moratorium new agency regulations running mate, mike pence, signed similar order became governor indiana. this give american companies certainty need reinvest community, get cash sidelines, start hiring new jobs, expanding businesses also immediately cancel illegal overreaching executive orders. next ask every federal agency prepare list regulations impose americans necessary, improve public safety, needlessly kill jobs. those regulations eliminated competition world want america win. when president, will. one important reforms trade reform bernie sanders said, hillary clinton bad judgment seen bad judgment overseas, libya, iraq, syria seen iran seen president obama, gives $150 billion iran, number one terror state, even gives $400 million money-laundered cash ransom payment. but also seen terrible obama-clinton judgment right detroit. hillary clinton supported trade deals stripping city, country, jobs wealth. she supported bill clinton nafta, supported china entrance world trade organization, supported job-killing trade deal south korea, supports trans-pacific partnership. let talk south korea moment, perfectly illustrates broken promises hurt many american workers. president obama, usual-called experts who wrong every trade deal decades, predicted trade deal south korea would increase exports south korea billion—resulting,000 jobs. like hillary clinton broken promises new york, pledges turned false. instead creating,000 jobs, killed nearly 100,000, according economic policy institute. our exports south korea increased all, imports surged billion—more doubling trade deficit country. the next betrayal trans-pacific partnership. hillary clinton closest friend, terry mcauliffe, confirmed said beginning: sent oval office, hillary clinton enact tpp. guaranteed. her donors make sure vote hillary clinton vote tpp—and also vote nafta. our annual trade deficit goods mexico risen close zero 1993 almost billion. our total trade deficit goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. this strike heart michigan, nation whole. according bureau labor statistics, nafta went effect, 285,000 auto workers michigan. today, number 160,000. detroit still waiting hillary clinton apology expect detroit get apology right around time hillary clinton turns,000 emails deleted. hillary clinton trans-pacific partnership tpp even bigger disaster auto industry fact, ford motor company announced opposition deal. according economic policy institute. trade deficit proposed tpp member countries cost million manufacturing jobs 2015 far biggest losses occurred motor vehicles parts, lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. michigan ranks first jobs lost share state workforce due trade deficit tpp members. just imagine many automobile jobs lost tpp actually approved. that announced withdraw deal ever happen. hillary clinton never withdraw tpp. she bought, controlled paid-for donors special interests. because interest american people previously laid detailed-point plan trade reform, available website includes strong protections currency manipulation, tariffs countries cheat unfairly subsidizing goods, includes renegotiation nafta get better deal, walk away center plan trade enforcement china. this alone could return millions jobs economy. china responsible nearly half entire trade deficit. they break rules every way imaginable. china engages illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, rampant theft intellectual property. they also real environmental labor protections, undercutting american workers. just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions american jobs. according. international trade commission, improved protection america intellectual property china would produce million jobs right united states. add saved jobs cracking currency cheating product dumping, bring trillions dollars new wealth wages back united states. trade big benefits favor trade. but want great trade deals country create jobs higher wages american workers. isolation option, great well-crafted trade deals are. also critical economic renewal energy reform the obama-clinton administration blocked destroyed millions jobs anti-energy regulations, raising price electricity families businesses result

"thank you, everybody, thank much great afternoon today begin conversation make america safe again twentieth century, united states defeated fascism, nazism communism. now, different threat faces world: radical islamic terrorism. this summer, there isis attack launched outside warzones middle east--hard believe--every eighty-four hours. here america, seen one brutal attack another: thirteen murdered thirty-eight wounded assault fort hood. the boston marathon bombing wounded maimed sixty-four people, ultimately left five dead, including two great police officers chattanooga, tennessee, five unarmed marines--unbelievable people, way--were shot killed military recruiting center. last september, fourteen innocent americans gunned office party san bernardino; another twenty-two gravely injured june, forty-nine americans executed pulse nightclub orlando . another fifty-three badly injured worst mass shooting history, attack, far, worst lgbtq community tell what: never, ever allow happen again europe--thank you europe seen carnage bloodshed afflicted upon closest allies january 2015, french satirical newspaper, charlie hebdo, attacked publishing cartoons prophet mohammed. twelve killed, including two police officers wounded. two days later, four murdered jewish delicatessen november 2015 terrorist went shooting rampage paris slaughtered 130 people, wounded another 368 people, very, very, bad shape today. france suffering gravely. and tourism industry massively affected negative way march year terrorists detonated bomb brussels airport killing injuring 340 people. this july south france islamic terrorist turned truck instrument mass murder, plowing killing men, women children wounding 308 people. terrible. among dead two americans, texas father-year-old son weeks ago germany refugee armed axe wounded people gruesome train attack. only days ago isis killer invaded christian church normandy, france forced- year-old priest knees priest beloved, beloved; cutting throat unthinkable things. overseas isis carried absolute atrocity one another. children slaughtered, girls sold slavery, men women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, drownings, ethnic minorities targeted mass execution. holy sites desecrated. christians driven homes hunted extermination. isis rounding calls 'nation cross', 'nation cross' campaign absolute total genocide cannot let evil continue.  thank you. thank you. nor let hateful ideology radical islam, oppression women, gays, children non-believers allowed reside spread within countries defeat radical islamic terrorism defeated every threat faced every age before. but not, not, remember this, defeat closed eyes silenced voices president want say words. anyone cannot name enemy fit lead country.  anyone cannot condemn hatred, oppression violence radical islam lacks moral clarity serve president.  the rise isis direct result policy decisions made president obama secretary state clinton. let look back middle east beginning 2009 obama-clinton administration took over. libya stable. syria control. egypt ruled secular president ally united states. iraq experiencing reduction violence. the group would become call isis close extinguished. iran choked economic sanctions. fast forward today. what have--and think this--and decisions made obama/clinton group absolutely disastrous. libya ruins. our ambassador three really brave americans dead. and isis gained new base operations. syria midst disastrous civil war. isis controls large portions territory refugee crisis threatens europe united states egypt, terrorists gained foothold sinai desert near suez canal, one essential waterways world. iraq chaos. and isis loose. isis spread across middle east west 2014, isis operating seven nations. they seven nations. terrible, that was. today they fully operational countries aspiring branches six total. and many believe number actually countries. they even know. the situation likely worse public idea new congressional report reveals administration downplayed growth isis percent analysts saying experience efforts manipulate findings trying make look much better bad time, isis trying infiltrate refugee flows europe united states. iran, world largest state sponsor terrorism, flush $150 billion cash released united states. plus remember two weeks ago, another $400 million actual cash obviously used ransom. worst all, nuclear deal puts iran, number one state sponsor radical islamic terrorism, path nuclear weapons short, obama/clinton foreign policy unleashed isis, destabilized middle east, put nation iran, chants, ""death america"", dominant position regional power fact aspiring dominant world power began 2009 become known president obama global apology tour remember remember. booing series speeches, president obama described america arrogant, dismissive, derisive, colonial power describing informed countries would speaking america past errors pledged would longer senior partner sought dictate terms lectured cia officers need acknowledge mistakes, described guantanamo bay rallying cry enemies. perhaps speech misguided president obama speech muslim world, delivered cairo, egypt, 2009 remember well winning cold war, president ronald reagan repeatedly touted superiority freedom communism called ussr evil empire. yet president obama delivered address cairo, moral courage could found would found. instead condemning oppression women gays many muslim nations, systematic violations human rights, financing global terrorism, president obama tried draw equivalency human rights record--and remember this, human rights--and theirs. the records unbelievable unmistakable. his naive words followed even naive actions. the failure establish new status forces agreement iraq election-driven timetable withdrawal surrendered gains country led directly rise isis without question.  the failures iraq compounded hillary clinton disaster, total disaster, libya. president obama since said regrets, really regrets, libya mistake made considers worst mistake. according then-secretary defense robert gates, invasion libya nearly split decision, hillary clinton forceful advocacy intervention deciding factor. that went. with one episode bad judgment another, hillary clinton policies launched isis onto world stage. yet, threw middle east violent turmoil, things turned really hot world country. the middle east particular. the clintons made almost,000 gross income secretary state unbelievable. incident incident proves hillary clinton lacks judgment said bernie sanders--stability temperament moral character lead nation.  importantly, also lacks mental physical stamina take isis many adversaries face. not terrorism, trade every challenge must confront turn great country around time new approach. our current strategy nation- building regime-change proven, absolute failure created vacuums allow terrorism grow thrive opponent iraq war beginning major difference opponent. though private citizen whose personal opinions matters really sought nonetheless publicly expressed private doubts invasion against, believe. three months invasion said interview neil cavuto offer best wishes speedy recovery, ""perhaps yet. and economy much bigger problem august 2004, early, right conflict made detailed statement esquire magazine interview. here quote full. ""look war iraq mess would never handled way."" this right invasion. ""does anybody really believe iraq going wonderful democracy people going run voting box gently put ballot winner happily going step lead country'mon continued, ""two minutes leave there going revolution meanest, toughest, smartest viscous guy, case, guy, take over. and weapons mass destruction saddam hussein have. ""what purpose whole thing? hundreds hundreds young people killed. and people coming back arms legs? not mention, fairness, side. the tremendous damage done. all iraqi kids who blown pieces. and turns reasons war blatantly wrong. all death destruction nothing clear long time gone. but clear saying catastrophic mistake hillary clinton president obama made reckless way pulled out. after made hard fought sacrifices gains never made sudden withdrawal timetable advertised enemies. they said moving out, here time, here date. who would incompetent president qaeda iraq decimated. and obama clinton gave new life allowed spread across world token president obama hillary clinton never attempted build democracy libya, push immediate regime change syria support overthrow mubarak egypt. one point this long said kept oil iraq said again. another area judgment proven correct said many times, virtually every time interviewed, keep oil, keep oil. according cnn, isis made much $500,000 oil sales 2014 alone. that really got started. fueling funding reign terror controlled oil like said should, could prevented rise isis iraq, cutting major source funding presence. forces necessary safeguard oil vital infrastructure products necessary oil saying constantly consistently whomever would listen said, ""keep oil. keep oil. keep oil. don let somebody else get listened would economic benefits oil wanted use help take care wounded soldiers families died war addition thousands lives would saved. this proposal nature would left soldiers place assets would soldiers guarding valuable supply oil old days, war, victor belonged spoils.  instead, got iraq ventures middle east, death, destruction tremendous financial loss. but time put mistakes past behind chart new course become president, era nation-building brought swift decisive end.  thank you. our new approach--which must shared parties america, allies overseas friends middle east--must halt spread radical islam. all actions oriented around goal country shares goal ally. very important. some share goal cannot always choose friends never fail recognize enemies president call international conference focused goal work side side friends middle east, including greatest ally israel partner king abdullah jordan president egypt, president sisi, others recognize ideology death must extinguished also work closely nato new mission previously said nato obsolete failed deal adequately terrorism. since comments, changed policy new division focused terror threats. very good. very, good also believe could find common ground russia fight isis. wouldn good thing? wouldn good thing?  they, too, much stake outcome syria, battles islamic terrorism bad ours. they big, big problem russia isis administration aggressively pursue joint coalition military operations crush destroy isis. international cooperation cut funding. expanded intelligence sharing, cyber warfare disrupt disable propaganda recruiting. their recruiting taking place right now, they setting records got stopped cannot allow internet used recruiting tool purposes enemy must shut access form communication, must immediately--immediately.  unlike hilary clinton, risked many lives careless handling sensitive information, administration telegram exactly military plans are.  and way, what happened,000-mails absolute disgrace united states america often said great general douglas macarthur great general george patton would state shock alive today see way president obama hillary clinton tried recklessly announce every move happens. like iraq, enemy prepare adapt. their enemy says, ""thank you."" the fight limited isis decimate- qaeda. and seek starve funding iran-backed hamas hezbollah important use existing. security council resolutions apply new even stronger sanctions. military, cyber financial warfare necessary dismantle islamic terrorism. but must use ideological warfare well. very important. and use, better ever even thought using them. but change. just won, cold war part exposing evils communism virtues free markets, must take ideology radical islam. while opponent accepted millions dollars foundation donations countries gay offense punishable prison death, administration speak oppression women, gays people different beliefs.  our administration would friend moderate muslim reformers middle east amplify voices. this includes speaking horrible practice honor killings, women murdered relatives dressing, marrying acting way violates fundamentalist teachings. over,000 pakistani girls estimated victims honor killings relatives year. recently prominent pakistani social media star strangled death brother charge dishonoring family confession, brother took pride murder said, ""girls born stay home follow traditions."" shockingly, tradition reached shores. one case, many, many cases happened--where one involves iraqi immigrant sentenced years jail running daughter, claiming ""too westernized defeat islamic terrorism must also speak forcefully hateful ideology provides breeding ground violence terrorism grow breeding ground terrible, terrible breeding ground new immigration policy needed immediately well.  the common thread linking major islamic terror attacks recently occurred soil, fort hood shooting, boston bombing, san bernardino attack, orlando attack involved immigrants children immigrants. clearly, new screening procedures needed review. senate immigration subcommittee identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged terrorism terrorism-related offenses 2014, many since then, year record identification gotten worse, far worse also know isis recruits refugees entrance country, seen somali refugee population minnesota. beyond terrorism, also seen france, foreign populations brought anti-semitic attitudes them cologne, germany new years, seen reports sexual violence assault far greater anybody knows. pew polling shows many countries draw large number immigrants--extreme views religion death penalty--and involved--the death penalty very, common faith demand have trump administration establish clear principle govern decisions pertaining immigration, tough, even extreme admit

"thank you, great florida days, going win state, going win white house. our movement replacing failed corrupt political establishment new government controlled you, american people. there nothing political establishment, lie tell, hold prestige power expense. the washington establishment, financial media corporations fund, exists one reason: protect enrich itself. the establishment trillions dollars stake election example, one single trade deal they like pass, involves trillions dollars controlled many countries, corporations lobbyists. for control levers power washington, global special interests partner with, campaign represents existential threat. this simply another-year election. this crossroads history civilization determine whether the people reclaim control government. the political establishment trying everything stop, group responsible disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, economic foreign policies bled country dry. the political establishment brought destruction factories jobs, flee mexico, china countries throughout world. our just-announced jobs numbers anemic, gross domestic product, gdp, barely one percent. workers united states, making less almost years ago  yet working harder global power structure responsible economic decisions robbed working class, stripped country wealth, put money pockets handful large corporations political entities. just look corrupt establishment done cities like detroit flint, michigan  rural towns pennsylvania, ohio, north carolina across country. they stripped towns bare, raided wealth taken away jobs. the clinton machine center power structure seen firsthand wikileaks documents hillary clinton meets secret international banks plot destruction. sovereignty order enrich global financial powers. and, likewise, emails show clinton machine closely irrevocably tied media organizations given questions answers advance debates. clinton also given approval veto power quotes written new york times. and emails show reporters collaborate conspire directly clinton campaign helping win election. with control government stake, trillions dollars line, clinton machine determined achieve destruction campaign, become movement likes country never seen  let that. the powerful weapon deployed clintons corporate media. let clear one thing: corporate media country longer involved journalism. they political special interest, different lobbyist financial entity agenda. and agenda elect clintons cost, price, matter many lives destroy. for them, war  them, nothing bounds. this struggle survival nation. this election determine whether free nation, whether illusion democracy fact controlled small handful global special interests rigging system. this conspiracy reality know. the establishment media enablers wield control nation means well known. anyone challenges control deemed sexist, racist, xenophobe morally deformed. they attack you, slander you, seek destroy career reputation. and lie, lie lie even more. the clintons criminals. this well-documented, establishment protects engaged massive cover widespread criminal activity state department clinton foundation order keep clintons power. never history seen cover this, one includes destruction,000 emails phones, laptops, missing boxes evidence. people capable crimes nation capable anything. and address slander libels last night thrown clinton machine, new york times, media outlets, part concerted, coordinated vicious attack coincidence attacks come exact moment, together time, wikileaks documents expose massive international corruption clinton machine  including,000 emails morning these claims inappropriate conduct women totally absolutely false  clinton machine knows fabricated pure fiction outright lies. these events never happened. the claims preposterous, ludicrous defy truth, common sense logic already substantial evidence dispute lies, made public appropriate way appropriate time. these lies come outlets whose past stories, past claims, already discredited. the media outlets even attempt confirm basic facts, even simple investigation would shown false smears. what happening different happened innocent people, like story written rolling stone magazine  magazine put business. six months ago, new york times wrote massive story attacking, central witness used said story false, quoted inaccurately. she said great guy, never made remarks demanded retraction, refused print  like refused print comments another source praised book, words another wonderful woman said nice things. that story fraud embarrassment new york times part lawsuit preparing them. now today, two discredited writers, fired times, tell totally fabricated false story supposedly took place airplane years ago  another ridiculous tale, witnesses, nothing. also, writer people magazine wrote story melania first anniversary. the story lovely last night hear years, new claim made inappropriate advances ask simple question, part story appeared years ago one biggest stars television, would one biggest stories year. take look words would headline, appears days election. this invented account already debunked eyewitness testimony  witness identified author said story entirely false. this weekend, new york times published full-page hit piece another claim individual totally discredited based emails letters sent office years. but new york times refused use evidence presented them. others likewise presented story, seeing evidence provided, refused print. this part concerted effort, led new york times,
